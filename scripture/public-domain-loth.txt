[Psalm 1] {1:1} Blessed is the man who has not followed the
counsel of the impious, and has not remained in the way of
sinners, and has not sat in the chair of pestilence. {1:2} But
his will is with the law of the Lord, and he will meditate on
his law, day and night. {1:3} And he will be like a tree that
has been planted beside running waters, which will provide
its fruit in its time, and its leaf will not fall away, and all
things whatsoever that he does will prosper. {1:4} Not so the
impious, not so. For they are like the dust that the wind casts
along the face of the earth. {1:5} Therefore, the impious will
not prevail again in judgment, nor sinners in the council of
the just. {1:6} For the Lord knows the way of the just. And
the path of the impious will pass away.


[Psalm 2] {2:1} Why have the Gentiles been seething, and
why have the people been pondering nonsense? {2:2} The
kings of the earth have stood up, and the leaders have joined
together as one, against the Lord and against his Christ:
{2:3} “Let us shatter their chains and cast their yoke away
from us.” {2:4} He who dwells in heaven will ridicule them,
and the Lord will mock them. {2:5} Then will he speak to
them in his anger and trouble them with his fury. {2:6} Yet I
have been appointed king by him over Zion, his holy
mountain, preaching his precepts. {2:7} The Lord has said to
me: You are my son, this day have I begotten you. {2:8} Ask
of me and I will give to you: the Gentiles for your inheritance,
and the ends of the earth for your possession. {2:9} You will
rule them with an iron rod, and you will shatter them like a
potter’s vessel. {2:10} And now, O kings, understand.
Receive instruction, you who judge the earth. {2:11} Serve
the Lord in fear, and exult in him with trembling.
{2:12} Embrace discipline, lest at any time the Lord might
become angry, and you would perish from the way of the just.
{2:13} Though his wrath can flare up in a short time, blessed
are all those who trust in him.


)Morning Prayer

[Psalm 3] {3:1} A Psalm of David. When he fled from the
face of his son, Absalom. {3:2} Lord, why have those who
trouble me been multiplied? Many rise up against me.
{3:3} Many say to my soul, “There is no salvation for him in
his God.” {3:4} But you, Lord, are my supporter, my glory,
and the one who raises up my head. {3:5} I have cried out to
the Lord with my voice, and he has heard me from his holy
mountain. {3:6} I have slept, and I have been stupefied. But I
awakened because the Lord has taken me up. {3:7} I will not
fear the thousands of people surrounding me. Rise up, Lord.
Save me, my God. {3:8} For you have struck all those who
oppose me without cause. You have broken the teeth of
sinners. {3:9} Salvation is of the Lord, and your blessing is
upon your people.


[Psalm 4] {4:1} In parts according to verses. A Psalm of
David. {4:2} When I called upon him, the God of my justice
heeded me. In tribulation, you have enlarged me. Have
mercy on me, and heed my prayer. {4:3} Sons of men, how
long will you be dull in heart, so that whatever you love is in
vain, and whatever you seek is false? {4:4} And know this:
the Lord has made wondrous his holy one. The Lord will
heed me when I cry out to him. {4:5} Be angry, and do not
be willing to sin. The things that you say in your hearts: be
sorry for them on your beds. {4:6} Offer the sacrifice of
justice, and hope in the Lord. Many say, “Who reveals to us
what is good?” {4:7} The light of your countenance, Lord,
has been sealed upon us. You have given joy to my heart.
{4:8} By the fruit of their grain, wine, and oil, they have been
multiplied. {4:9} In peace itself, I will sleep and I will rest.
{4:10} For you, O Lord, have established me singularly in
hope.


[Gospel Canticle] {1:68} “Blessed is the Lord God of Israel. For he has
visited and has wrought the redemption of his people.
{1:69} And he has raised up a horn of salvation for us, in the
house of David his servant, {1:70} just as he spoke by the
mouth of his holy Prophets, who are from ages past:
{1:71} salvation from our enemies, and from the hand of all
those who hate us, {1:72} to accomplish mercy with our
fathers, and to call to mind his holy testament, {1:73} the
oath, which he swore to Abraham, our father, that he would
grant to us, {1:74} so that, having been freed from the hand
of our enemies, we may serve him without fear, {1:75} in
holiness and in justice before him, throughout all our days.
{1:76} And you, child, shall be called the prophet of the Most
High. For you will go before the face of the Lord: to prepare
his ways, {1:77} to give knowledge of salvation to his people
for the remission of their sins, {1:78} through the heart of the
mercy of our God, by which, descending from on high, he
has visited us, {1:79} to illuminate those who sit in darkness
and in the shadow of death, and to direct our feet in the way
of peace.”


)Midday Prayer

[Psalm 5] {5:1} Unto the end. For her who pursues the
inheritance. A Psalm of David. {5:2} O Lord, listen closely to
my words. Understand my outcry. {5:3} Attend to the voice
of my prayer, my King and my God. {5:4} For to you, I will
pray. In the morning, Lord, you will hear my voice. {5:5} In
the morning, I will stand before you, and I will see. For you
are not a God who wills iniquity. {5:6} And the malicious
will not dwell close to you, nor will the unjust endure before
your eyes. {5:7} You hate all who work iniquity. You will
destroy all who speak a lie. The bloody and deceitful man,
the Lord will abominate. {5:8} But I am in the multitude of
your mercy. I will enter your house. I will show adoration
toward your holy temple, in your fear. {5:9} Lord, lead me in
your justice. Because of my enemies, direct my way in your
sight. {5:10} For there is no truth in their mouth: their heart
is vain. {5:11} Their throat is an open sepulcher. They have
acted deceitfully with their tongues. Judge them, O God. Let
them fall by their own intentions: according to the multitude
of their impiety, expel them. For they have provoked you, O
Lord. {5:12} But let all those who hope in you rejoice. They
will exult in eternity, and you will dwell in them. And all
those who love your name will glory in you. {5:13} For you
will bless the just. You have crowned us, O Lord, as if with a
shield of your good will.


)Evening Prayer

[Psalm 6] {6:1} In parts according to verses. A Psalm of
David. For the octave. {6:2} O Lord, do not rebuke me in
your fury, nor chastise me in your anger. {6:3} Have mercy
on me, Lord, for I am weak. Heal me, Lord, for my bones
have become disturbed, {6:4} and my soul has been very
troubled. But as for you, Lord, when? {6:5} Turn to me, Lord,
and rescue my soul. Save me because of your mercy.
{6:6} For there is no one in death who would be mindful of
you. And who will confess to you in Hell? {6:7} I have
labored in my groaning. Every night, with my tears, I will
wash my bed and drench my blanket. {6:8} My eye has been
troubled by rage. I have grown old among all my enemies.
{6:9} Scatter before me, all you who work iniquity, for the
Lord has heard the voice of my weeping. {6:10} The Lord
has heard my supplication. The Lord has accepted my prayer.
{6:11} Let all my enemies be ashamed and together be
greatly troubled. May they be converted and become
ashamed very quickly.


[Psalm 7] {7:1} A Psalm of David, which he sang to the
Lord because of the words of Cush, the son of Jemini.
{7:2} O Lord, my God, in you I have hoped. Save me from
all those who persecute me, and free me: {7:3} lest at any
time, like a lion, he might seize my soul, while there is no one
to redeem me, nor any who can save. {7:4} O Lord, my God,
if there is iniquity in my hands, if I have done this: {7:5} if I
have repaid those who rendered evils to me, may I deservedly
fall away empty before my enemies: {7:6} let the enemy
pursue my soul, and take hold of it, and trample my life into
the earth, and drag down my glory into the dust. {7:7} Rise
up, Lord, in your anger. And be exalted to the borders of my
enemies. And rise up, O Lord my God, according to the
precept that you commanded, {7:8} and a congregation of
people will surround you. And, because of this, return on
high. {7:9} The Lord judges the people. Judge me, O Lord,
according to my justice and according to my innocence
within me. {7:10} The wickedness of sinners will be
consumed, and you will direct the just: the examiner of hearts
and temperaments is God. {7:11} Just is my help from the
Lord, who saves the upright of heart. {7:12} God is a just
judge, strong and patient. How could he be angry throughout
every day? {7:13} Unless you will be converted, he will
brandish his sword. He has extended his bow and made it
ready. {7:14} And with it, he has prepared instruments of
death. He has produced his arrows for those on fire.
{7:15} Behold him who has given birth to injustice: he has
conceived sorrow and has begotten iniquity. {7:16} He has
opened a pit and enlarged it. And he has fallen into the hole
that he made. {7:17} His sorrow will be turned upon his own
head, and his iniquity will descend upon his highest point.
{7:18} I will confess to the Lord according to his justice, and
I will sing a psalm to the name of the Lord Most High.


[Gospel Canticle} “My soul magnifies
the Lord. {1:47} And my spirit leaps for joy in God my
Saviour. {1:48} For he has looked with favor on the humility
of his handmaid. For behold, from this time, all generations
shall call me blessed. {1:49} For he who is great has done
great things for me, and holy is his name. {1:50} And his
mercy is from generation to generations for those who fear
him. {1:51} He has accomplished powerful deeds with his
arm. He has scattered the arrogant in the intentions of their
heart. {1:52} He has deposed the powerful from their seat,
and he has exalted the humble. {1:53} He has filled the
hungry with good things, and the rich he has sent away
empty. {1:54} He has taken up his servant Israel, mindful of
his mercy, {1:55} just as he spoke to our fathers: to Abraham
and to his offspring forever.”


)Night Prayer

[Psalm 8] {8:1} Unto the end. For the oil and wine presses.
A Psalm of David. {8:2} O Lord, our Lord, how admirable is
your name throughout all the earth! For your magnificence is
elevated above the heavens. {8:3} Out of the mouths of babes
and infants, you have perfected praise, because of your
enemies, so that you may destroy the enemy and the revenger.
{8:4} For I will behold your heavens, the works of your
fingers: the moon and the stars, which you have founded.
{8:5} What is man, that you are mindful of him, or the son of
man, that you visit him? {8:6} You reduced him to a little
less than the Angels; you have crowned him with glory and
honor, {8:7} and you have set him over the works of your
hands. {8:8} You have subjected all things under his feet, all
sheep and oxen, and in addition: the beasts of the field,
{8:9} the birds of the air, and the fish of the sea, which pass
through the paths of the sea. {8:10} O Lord, our Lord, how
admirable is your name throughout all the earth!


[Gospel Canticle] {2:29} “Now you may dismiss your servant in peace, O Lord,
according to your word. {2:30} For my eyes have seen your
salvation, {2:31} which you have prepared before the face of
all peoples: {2:32} the light of revelation to the nations and
the glory of your people Israel.”

)Office of Readings

[Psalm 9] (Psalm 9 - 10) {9:1} Unto the end. For the secrets
of the Son. A Psalm of David. {9:2} I will confess to you,
Lord, with my whole heart. I will recount all your wonders.
{9:3} I will rejoice and exult in you. I will sing a psalm to
your name, O Most High. {9:4} For my enemy will be turned
back. They will be weakened and perish before your face.
{9:5} For you have accomplished my judgment and my cause.
You have sat upon the throne that judges justice. {9:6} You
have rebuked the Gentiles, and the impious one has perished.
You have deleted their name in eternity and for all
generations. {9:7} The spears of the enemy have failed in the
end, and their cities, you have destroyed. Their memory has
perished with a loud noise. {9:8} But the Lord remains in
eternity. He has prepared his throne in judgment. {9:9} And
he will judge the whole world in equity. He will judge the
people in justice. {9:10} And the Lord has become a refuge
for the poor, a helper in opportunity, in tribulation.
{9:11} And may they hope in you, who know your name.
For you have not abandoned those seeking you, Lord.
{9:12} Sing a psalm to the Lord, who dwells in Zion.
Announce his study among the Gentiles. {9:13} Because of
those who yearned for their blood, he has remembered them.
He has not forgotten the cry of the poor. {9:14} Have mercy
on me, Lord. See my humiliation from my enemies.
{9:15} You lift me up from the gates of death, so that I may
announce all your praises at the gates of the daughter of Zion.
{9:16} I will exult in your salvation. The Gentiles have
become trapped in the ruin that they made. Their foot has
been caught in the same snare that they themselves had
hidden. {9:17} The Lord will be recognized when making
judgments. The sinner has been caught in the works of his
own hands. {9:18} The sinners will be turned into Hell: all
the Gentiles who have forgotten God. {9:19} For the poor
will not be forgotten in the end. The patience of the poor will
not perish in the end. {9:20} Rise up, Lord: do not let man be
strengthened. Let the Gentiles be judged in your sight.
{9:21} O Lord, establish a lawgiver over them, so that the
Gentiles may know that they are only men.
{9:22} So then, why, O Lord, have you withdrawn far away?
Why have you overlooked us in opportunity, in tribulation?
{9:23} While the impious is arrogant, the poor is enflamed.
They are held by the counsels that they devise. {9:24} For the
sinner is praised by the desires of his soul, and the iniquitous
is blessed. {9:25} The sinner has provoked the Lord;
according to the multitude of his wrath, he will not seek him.
{9:26} God is not before his sight. His ways are stained at all
times. Your judgments are removed from his face. He will be
master of all his enemies. {9:27} For he has said in his heart,
“I will not be disturbed: from generation to generation
without evil.” {9:28} His mouth is full of curses, and
bitterness, and deceit. Under his tongue are hardship and
sorrow. {9:29} He sits in ambush, with resources in hidden
places, so that he may execute the innocent. {9:30} His eyes
catch sight of the poor. He lies in ambush, in hiding like a
lion in his den. He lies in ambush, so that he may seize the
poor, to seize the poor as he draws him in. {9:31} With his
snare, he will bring him down. He will crouch down and
pounce, when he has power over the poor. {9:32} For he has
said in his heart, “God has forgotten, he has turned away his
face, lest he see to the end.” {9:33} O Lord God, rise up. Let
your hand be exalted. Do not forget the poor. {9:34} How
has the impious one provoked God? For he has said in his
heart, “He will not inquire.” {9:35} You do see, for you
examine hardship and sorrow, so that you may deliver them
into your hands. The poor one has been abandoned to you.
You will be a helper to the orphan. {9:36} Break the arm of
the sinner and the malicious. His sin will be sought, and it
will not be found. {9:37} The Lord shall reign in eternity,
even forever and ever. You will perish the Gentiles from his
land. {9:38} The Lord has heeded the desire of the poor.
Your ear has listened to the preparation of their heart,
{9:39} so as to judge for the orphan and the humble, so that
man may no longer presume to magnify himself upon the
earth.


[Psalm 10] (Psalm 11) {10:1} Unto the end. A Psalm of
David. {10:2} I trust in the Lord. How can you say to my
soul, “Sojourn to the mountain, like a sparrow.” {10:3} For
behold, the sinners have bent their bow. They have prepared
their arrows in the quiver, so as to shoot arrows in the dark at
the upright of heart. {10:4} For they have destroyed the
things that you have completed. But what has the just one
done? {10:5} The Lord is in his holy temple. The Lord’s
throne is in heaven. His eyes look upon the poor. His eyelids
question the sons of men. {10:6} The Lord questions the just
and the impious. Yet he who loves iniquity, hates his own
soul. {10:7} He will rain down snares upon sinners. Fire and
brimstone and windstorms will be the portion of their cup.
{10:8} For the Lord is just, and he has chosen justice. His
countenance has beheld equity.


)Morning Prayer

[Psalm 11] (Psalm 12) {11:1} Unto the end. For the octave.
A Psalm of David. {11:2} Save me, O Lord, because holiness
has passed away, because truths have been diminished,
before the sons of men. {11:3} They have been speaking
emptiness, each one to his neighbor; they have been speaking
with deceitful lips and a duplicitous heart. {11:4} May the
Lord scatter all deceitful lips, along with the tongue that
speaks malice. {11:5} They have said: “We will magnify our
tongue; our lips belong to us. What is Lord to us?”
{11:6} Because of the misery of the destitute and the
groaning of the poor, now I will arise, says the Lord. I will
place him in safety. I will act faithfully toward him.
{11:7} The eloquence of the Lord is pure eloquence, silver
tested by fire, purged from the earth, refined seven times.
{11:8} You, O Lord, will preserve us, and you will guard us
from this generation into eternity. {11:9} The impious
wander aimlessly. According to your loftiness, you have
multiplied the sons of men.


[Psalm 12] (Psalm 13) {12:1} Unto the end. A Psalm of
David. How long, O Lord? Will you forget me until the end?
How long will you turn your face away from me?
{12:2} How long can IJ take counsel in my soul, sorrowing in
my heart throughout the day? {12:3} How long will my
enemy be exalted over me? {12:4} Look upon me and listen
to me, O Lord my God. Enlighten my eyes, lest I fall asleep
forever in death, {12:5} lest at any time my enemy may say,
“I have prevailed against him.” Those who trouble me will
exult, if I have been disturbed. {12:6} But I have hoped in
your mercy. My heart will exult in your salvation. I will sing
to the Lord, who assigns good things to me. And I will sing
psalms to the name of the Lord Most High.


[Gospel Canticle] {1:68} “Blessed is the Lord God of Israel. For he has
visited and has wrought the redemption of his people.
{1:69} And he has raised up a horn of salvation for us, in the
house of David his servant, {1:70} just as he spoke by the
mouth of his holy Prophets, who are from ages past:
{1:71} salvation from our enemies, and from the hand of all
those who hate us, {1:72} to accomplish mercy with our
fathers, and to call to mind his holy testament, {1:73} the
oath, which he swore to Abraham, our father, that he would
grant to us, {1:74} so that, having been freed from the hand
of our enemies, we may serve him without fear, {1:75} in
holiness and in justice before him, throughout all our days.
{1:76} And you, child, shall be called the prophet of the Most
High. For you will go before the face of the Lord: to prepare
his ways, {1:77} to give knowledge of salvation to his people
for the remission of their sins, {1:78} through the heart of the
mercy of our God, by which, descending from on high, he
has visited us, {1:79} to illuminate those who sit in darkness
and in the shadow of death, and to direct our feet in the way
of peace.”


)Midday Prayer

[Psalm 13] (Psalm 14) {13:1} Unto the end. A Psalm of
David. The fool has said in his heart, “There is no God.”
They were corrupted, and they have become abominable in
their studies. There is no one who does good; there is not
even one. {13:2} The Lord has looked down from heaven
upon the sons of men, to see if there were any who were
considering or seeking God. {13:3} They have all gone astray;
together they have become useless. There is no one who does
good; there is not even one. {13:4} Their throat is an open
sepulcher. With their tongues, they have been acting
deceitfully; the venom of asps is under their lips. Their mouth
is full of curses and bitterness. {13:5} Their feet are swift to
shed blood. Grief and unhappiness are in their ways; and the
way of peace, they have not known. {13:6} There is no fear
of God before their eyes. {13:7} Will they never learn: all
those who work iniquity, who devour my people like a meal
of bread? {13:8} They have not called upon the Lord. There,
they have trembled in fear, where there was no fear.
{13:9} For the Lord is with the just generation. You have
confounded the counsel of the needy because the Lord is his
hope. {13:10} Who will grant the salvation of Israel from
Zion? When the Lord turns away the captivity of his people,
Jacob will exult, and Israel will rejoice.


)Evening Prayer

[Psalm 14] (Psalm 15) {14:1} A Psalm of David. O Lord,
who will dwell in your tabernacle? Or who will rest on your
holy mountain? {14:2} He who walks without blemish and
who works justice. {14:3} He who speaks the truth in his
heart, who has not acted deceitfully with his tongue, and has
not done evil to his neighbor, and has not taken up a
reproach against his neighbors. {14:4} In his sight, the
malicious one has been reduced to nothing, but he glorifies
those who fear the Lord. He who swears to his neighbor and
does not deceive. {14:5} He who has not given his money in
usury, nor accepted bribes against the innocent. He who does
these things will be undisturbed for eternity.


[Psalm 15] (Psalm 16) {15:1} The inscription of a title: of
David himself. Preserve me, O Lord, because I have hoped in
you. {15:2} I have said to the Lord: “You are my God, so
you have no need of my goodness.” {15:3} As for the saints,
who are in his land: he has made all my desires wonderful in
them. {15:4} Their infirmities have been multiplied; after this,
they acted more quickly. I will not gather for their
convocations of blood, nor will I remember their names with
my lips. {15:5} The Lord is the portion of my inheritance and
my cup. It is you who will restore my inheritance to me.
{15:6} The lots have fallen upon me with clarity. And,
indeed, my inheritance has been very clear to me. {15:7} I
will bless the Lord, who has bestowed understanding upon
me. Moreover, my temperament has also corrected me, even
through the night. {15:8} I have made provision for the Lord
always in my sight. For he is at my right hand, so that I may
not be disturbed. {15:9} Because of this, my heart has been
joyful, and my tongue has exulted. Moreover, even my body
will rest in hope. {15:10} For you will not abandon my soul
to Hell, nor will you allow your holy one to see corruption.
{15:11} You have made known to me the ways of life; you
will fill me with joy by your countenance. At your right hand
are delights, even to the end.


[Gospel Canticle} “My soul magnifies
the Lord. {1:47} And my spirit leaps for joy in God my
Saviour. {1:48} For he has looked with favor on the humility
of his handmaid. For behold, from this time, all generations
shall call me blessed. {1:49} For he who is great has done
great things for me, and holy is his name. {1:50} And his
mercy is from generation to generations for those who fear
him. {1:51} He has accomplished powerful deeds with his
arm. He has scattered the arrogant in the intentions of their
heart. {1:52} He has deposed the powerful from their seat,
and he has exalted the humble. {1:53} He has filled the
hungry with good things, and the rich he has sent away
empty. {1:54} He has taken up his servant Israel, mindful of
his mercy, {1:55} just as he spoke to our fathers: to Abraham
and to his offspring forever.”


)Night Prayer

[Psalm 16] (Psalm 17) {16:1} A Prayer of David. Lord, listen
to my justice, attend to my supplication. Pay attention to my
prayer, which is not from deceitful lips. {16:2} Let my
judgment proceed from your presence. Let your eyes behold
fairness. {16:3} You have tested my heart and visited it by
night. You have examined me by fire, and iniquity has not
been found in me. {16:4} Therefore, may my mouth not
speak the works of men. I have kept to difficult ways because
of the words of your lips. {16:5} Perfect my steps in your
paths, so that my footsteps may not be disturbed. {16:6} I
have cried out because you, O God, have listened to me.
Incline your ear to me and heed my words. {16:7} Make
your mercies wonderful, for you save those who hope in you.
{16:8} From those who resist your right hand, preserve me
like the pupil of your eye. Protect me under the shadow of
your wings, {16:9} from the face of the impious who have
afflicted me. My enemies have surrounded my soul.
{16:10} They have concealed their fatness; their mouth has
been speaking arrogantly. {16:11} They have cast me out,
and now they have surrounded me. They have cast their eyes
down to the earth. {16:12} They have taken me, like a lion
ready for the prey, and like a young lion dwelling in hiding.
{16:13} Rise up, O Lord, arrive before him and displace him.
Deliver my soul from the impious one: your spear from the
enemies of your hand. {16:14} Lord, divide them from the
few of the earth in their life. Their gut has been filled from
your hidden stores. They have been filled with sons, and they
have bequeathed to their little ones the remainder.
{16:15} But as for me, I will appear before your sight in
justice. I will be satisfied when your glory appears.


[Gospel Canticle] {2:29} “Now you may dismiss your servant in peace, O Lord,
according to your word. {2:30} For my eyes have seen your
salvation, {2:31} which you have prepared before the face of
all peoples: {2:32} the light of revelation to the nations and
the glory of your people Israel.”

)Office of Readings

[Psalm 17] (Psalm 18) {17:1} Unto the end. For David, the
servant of the Lord, who spoke the words of this canticle to
the Lord, in the day that the Lord delivered him from the
hand of all his enemies and from the hand of Saul. And he
said: {17:2} I will love you, O Lord my strength. {17:3} The
Lord is my firmament, my refuge, and my liberator. My God
is my helper, and I hope in him: my protector, and the horn
of my salvation, and my support. {17:4} Praising, I will call
upon the Lord. And I will be saved from my enemies.
{17:5} The sorrows of death surrounded me, and the torrents
of iniquity dismayed me. {17:6} The sorrows of Hell
encompassed me, and the snares of death intercepted me.
{17:7} In my tribulation, I called upon the Lord, and I cried
out to my God. And he listened to my voice from his holy
temple. And my cry in his presence entered into his ears.
{17:8} The earth was shaken, and it trembled. The
foundations of the mountains were disturbed, and they were
shaken, because he was angry with them. {17:9} A smoke
ascended by his wrath, and a fire flared up from his face:
coals were kindled by it. {17:10} He bent the heavens, and
they descended. And darkness was under his feet.
{17:11} And he ascended upon the cherubim, and he flew: he
flew upon the feathers of the winds. {17:12} And he set
darkness as his hiding place, with his tabernacle all around
him: dark waters in the clouds of the air. {17:13} At the
brightness that was before his sight, the clouds crossed by,
with hail and coals of fire. {17:14} And the Lord thundered
from heaven, and the Most High uttered his voice: hail and
coals of fire. {17:15} And he sent forth his arrows and
scattered them. He multiplied lightnings, and he set them in
disarray. {17:16} Then the fountains of waters appeared, and
the foundations of the world were revealed, by your rebuke,
O Lord, by the inspiration of the Spirit of your wrath.
{17:17} He sent from on high, and he accepted me. And he
took me up, out of many waters. {17:18} He rescued me
from my strongest enemies, and from those who hated me.
For they had been too strong for me. {17:19} They
intercepted me in the day of my affliction, and the Lord
became my protector. {17:20} And he led me out, into a wide
place. He accomplished my salvation, because he willed me.
{17:21} And the Lord will reward me according to my justice,
and he will repay me according to the purity of my hands.
{17:22} For I have preserved the ways of the Lord, and I
have not behaved impiously before my God. {17:23} For all
his judgments are in my sight, and his justice, I have not
pushed away from me. {17:24} And I will be immaculate
together with him, and I will keep myself from my iniquity.
{17:25} And the Lord will reward me according to my justice
and according to the purity of my hands before his eyes.
{17:26} With the holy, you will be holy, and with the
innocent, you will be innocent, {17:27} and with the elect,
you will be elect, and with the perverse, you will be perverse.
{17:28} For you will save the humble people, but you will
bring down the eyes of the arrogant. {17:29} For you
illuminate my lamp, O Lord. My God, enlighten my
darkness. {17:30} For in you, I will be delivered from
temptation; and with my God, I will climb over a wall.
{17:31} As for my God, his way is undefiled. The eloquence
of the Lord has been examined by fire. He is the protector of
all who hope in him. {17:32} For who is God, except the
Lord? And who is God, except our God? {17:33} It is God
who has wrapped me with virtue and made my way
immaculate. {17:34} It is he who has perfected my feet, like
the feet of deer, and who stations me upon the heights.
{17:35} It is he who trains my hands for battle. And you have
set my arms like a bow of brass. {17:36} And you have given
me the protection of your salvation. And your right hand
sustains me. And your discipline has corrected me unto the
end. And your discipline itself will teach me. {17:37} You
have expanded my footsteps under me, and my tracks have
not been weakened. {17:38} I will pursue my enemies and
apprehend them. And I will not turn back until they have
failed. {17:39} I will break them, and they will not be able to
stand. They will fall under my feet. {17:40} And you have
wrapped me with virtue for the battle. And those rising up
against me, you have subdued under me. {17:41} And you
have given the back of my enemies to me, and you have
destroyed those who hated me. {17:42} They cried out, but
there was none to save them, to the Lord, but he did not heed
them. {17:43} And I will crush them into dust before the face
of the wind, so that I will obliterate them like the mud in the
streets. {17:44} You will rescue me from the contradictions of
the people. You will set me at the head of the Gentiles.
{17:45} A people I did not know has served me. As soon as
their ears heard, they were obedient to me. {17:46} The sons
of foreigners have been deceitful to me, the sons of foreigners
have grown weak with time, and they have wavered from
their paths. {17:47} The Lord lives, and blessed is my God,
and may the God of my salvation be exalted: {17:48} O God,
who vindicates me and who subdues the people under me,
my liberator from my enraged enemies. {17:49} And you will
exalt me above those who rise up against me. From the
iniquitous man, you will rescue me. {17:50} Because of this,
O Lord, I will confess to you among the nations, and I will
compose a psalm to your name: {17:51} magnifying the
salvation of his king, and showing mercy to David, his Christ,
and to his offspring, even for all time.


[Psalm 18] (Psalm 19) {18:1} Unto the end. A Psalm of
David. {18:2} The heavens describe the glory of God, and
the firmament announces the work of his hands. {18:3} Day
proclaims the word to day, and night to night imparts
knowledge. {18:4} There are no speeches or conversations,
where their voices are not being heard. {18:5} Their sound
has gone forth through all the earth, and their words to the
ends of the world. {18:6} He has placed his tabernacle in the
sun, and he is like a bridegroom coming out of his bedroom.
He has exulted like a giant running along the way; {18:7} his
departure is from the summit of heaven. And his course
reaches all the way to its summit. Neither is there anyone
who can hide himself from his heat. {18:8} The law of the
Lord is immaculate, converting souls. The testimony of the
Lord is faithful, providing wisdom to little ones. {18:9} The
justice of the Lord is right, rejoicing hearts. The precepts of
the Lord are brilliant, enlightening the eyes. {18:10} The fear
of the Lord is holy, enduring for all generations. The
judgments of the Lord are true, justified in themselves:
{18:11} desirable beyond gold and many precious stones, and
sweeter than honey and the honeycomb. {18:12} For, indeed,
your servant keeps them, and in keeping them, there are
many rewards. {18:13} Who can understand transgression?
From my hidden faults, cleanse me, O Lord, {18:14} and
from those of others, spare your servant. If they will have no
dominion over me, then I will be immaculate, and I will be
cleansed from the greatest transgression. {18:15} And the
eloquence of my mouth will be so as to please, along with the
meditation of my heart, in your sight, forever, O Lord, my
helper and my redeemer.


)Morning Prayer

[Psalm 19] (Psalm 20) {19:1} Unto the end. A Psalm of
David. {19:2} May the Lord hear you in the day of
tribulation. May the name of the God of Jacob protect you.
{19:3} May he send you help from the sanctuary and watch
over you from Zion. {19:4} May he be mindful of all your
sacrifices, and may your burnt-offerings be fat. {19:5} May
he grant to you according to your heart, and confirm all your
counsels. {19:6} We will rejoice in your salvation, and in the
name of our God, we will be magnified. {19:7} May the Lord
fulfill all your petitions. Now I know that the Lord has saved
his Christ. He will hear him from his holy heaven. The
salvation of his right hand is in his power. {19:8} Some trust
in chariots, and some in horses, but we will call upon the
name of the Lord our God. {19:9} They have been bound,
and they have fallen. But we have risen up, and we have been
set upright. {19:10} O Lord, save the king, and hear us on the
day that we will call upon you.


[Psalm 20] (Psalm 21) {20:1} Unto the end. A Psalm of
David. {20:2} In your virtue, Lord, the king will rejoice, and
over your salvation, he will exult exceedingly. {20:3} You
have granted him the desire of his heart, and you have not
cheated him of the wish of his lips. {20:4} For you have gone
ahead of him with blessings of sweetness. You have placed a
crown of precious stones on his head. {20:5} He petitioned
you for life, and you have granted him length of days, in the
present time, and forever and ever. {20:6} Great is his glory
in your salvation. Glory and great adornment, you will lay
upon him. {20:7} For you will give him as a blessing forever
and ever. You will make him rejoice with gladness in your
presence. {20:8} Because the king hopes in the Lord, and in
the mercy of the Most High, he will not be disturbed.
{20:9} May your hand be found by all your enemies. May
your right hand discover all those who hate you. {20:10} You
will make them like an oven of fire, in the time of your
presence. The Lord will stir them up with his wrath, and fire
will devour them. {20:11} You will destroy their fruit from
the earth and their offspring from the sons of men.
{20:12} For they have turned evils upon you; they have
devised plans, which they have not been able to accomplish.
{20:13} For you will make them turn their back; with your
remnants, you will prepare their countenance. {20:14} Be
exalted, Lord, by your own power. We will play music and
sing psalms to your virtues.


[Gospel Canticle] {1:68} “Blessed is the Lord God of Israel. For he has
visited and has wrought the redemption of his people.
{1:69} And he has raised up a horn of salvation for us, in the
house of David his servant, {1:70} just as he spoke by the
mouth of his holy Prophets, who are from ages past:
{1:71} salvation from our enemies, and from the hand of all
those who hate us, {1:72} to accomplish mercy with our
fathers, and to call to mind his holy testament, {1:73} the
oath, which he swore to Abraham, our father, that he would
grant to us, {1:74} so that, having been freed from the hand
of our enemies, we may serve him without fear, {1:75} in
holiness and in justice before him, throughout all our days.
{1:76} And you, child, shall be called the prophet of the Most
High. For you will go before the face of the Lord: to prepare
his ways, {1:77} to give knowledge of salvation to his people
for the remission of their sins, {1:78} through the heart of the
mercy of our God, by which, descending from on high, he
has visited us, {1:79} to illuminate those who sit in darkness
and in the shadow of death, and to direct our feet in the way
of peace.”


)Midday Prayer

[Psalm 21] (Psalm 22) {21:1} Unto the end. For the tasks of
early morning. A Psalm of David. {21:2} O God, my God,
look upon me. Why have you forsaken me? Far from my
salvation are the words of my offenses. {21:3} My God, I will
cry out by day, and you will not heed, and by night, and it
will not be foolishness for me. {21:4} But you dwell in
holiness, O Praise of Israel. {21:5} In you, our fathers have
hoped. They hoped, and you freed them. {21:6} They cried
out to you, and they were saved. In you, they hoped and
were not confounded. {21:7} But I am a worm and not a
man: a disgrace among men, and an outcast of the people.
{21:8} All those who saw me have derided me. They have
spoken with the lips and shook the head. {21:9} He has
hoped in the Lord, let him rescue him. Let him save him
because he chooses him. {21:10} For you are the one who
has drawn me out of the womb, my hope from the breasts of
my mother. {21:11} I have been thrown upon you from the
womb; from the womb of my mother, you are my God.
{21:12} Do not depart from me. For tribulation is near, since
there is no one who may help me. {21:13} Many calves have
surrounded me; fat bulls have besieged me. {21:14} They
have opened their mouths over me, just like a lion seizing
and roaring. {21:15} And so, I have been poured out like
water, and all my bones have been scattered. My heart has
become like wax, melting in the midst of my chest.
{21:16} My strength has dried up like clay, and my tongue
has adhered to my jaws. And you have pulled me down, into
the dust of death. {21:17} For many dogs have surrounded
me. The council of the malicious has besieged me. They have
pierced my hands and feet. {21:18} They have numbered all
my bones. And they have examined me and stared at me.
{21:19} They divided my garments among them, and over
my vestment, they cast lots. {21:20} But you, O Lord, do not
take your help far from me; be attentive to my defense.
{21:21} O God, rescue my soul from the spear, and my only
one from the hand of the dog. {21:22} Save me from the
mouth of the lion, and my humility from the horns of single-
horned beast. {21:23}I will declare your name to my
brothers. In the midst of the Church, I will praise you.
{21:24} You who fear the Lord, praise him. All the offspring
of Jacob, glorify him. {21:25} May all the offspring of Israel
fear him. For he has neither spurned nor despised the pleas of
the poor. Neither has he turned his face away from me. And
when I cried out to him, he heeded me. {21:26} My praise is
with you, within a great church. I will pay my vows in the
sight of those who fear him. {21:27} The poor will eat and be
satisfied, and those who yearn for the Lord will praise him.
Their hearts will live forever and ever. {21:28} All the ends of
the earth will remember, and they will be converted to the
Lord. And all the families of the Gentiles will adore in his
sight. {21:29} For the kingdom belongs to the Lord, and he
will have dominion over the Gentiles. {21:30} All the fat of
the earth have gnashed their teeth, and they have adored. In
his sight, they will fall down, all those who descend to the
ground. {21:31} And my soul will live for him, and my
offspring will serve him. {21:32} There will be announced for
the Lord a future generation, and the heavens will announce
his justice to a people who will be born, whom the Lord has
made.


)Evening Prayer

[Psalm 22] (Psalm 23) {22:1} A Psalm of David. The Lord
directs me, and nothing will be lacking to me. {22:2} He has
settled me here, in a place of pasture. He has led me out to
the water of refreshment. {22:3} He has converted my soul.
He has led me away on the paths of justice, for the sake of his
name. {22:4} For, even if I should walk in the midst of the
shadow of death, I will fear no evils. For you are with me.
Your rod and your staff, they have given me consolation.
{22:5} You have prepared a table in my sight, opposite those
who trouble me. You have anointed my head with oil, and
my cup, which inebriates me, how brilliant it is! {22:6} And
your mercy will follow me all the days of my life, and so may
I dwell in the house of the Lord for length of days.


[Psalm 23] (Psalm 24) {23:1} For the First Sabbath. A Psalm
of David. The earth and all its fullness belong to the Lord: the
whole world and all that dwells in it. {23:2} For he has
founded it upon the seas, and he has prepared it upon the
rivers. {23:3} Who will ascend to the mountain of the Lord?
And who will stand in his holy place? {23:4} The innocent of
hands and the clean of heart, who has not received his soul in
vain, nor sworn deceitfully to his neighbor. {23:5} He will
receive a blessing from the Lord, and mercy from God, his
Saviour. {23:6} This is the generation that seeks him, that
seeks the face of the God of Jacob. {23:7} Lift up your gates,
you princes, and be lifted up, eternal gates. And the King of
Glory shall enter. {23:8} Who is this King of Glory? The
Lord who is strong and powerful; the Lord powerful in battle.
{23:9} Lift up your gates, you princes, and be lifted up,
eternal gates. And the King of Glory shall enter.
{23:10} Who is this King of Glory? The Lord of virtue. He
himself is the King of Glory.


[Gospel Canticle} “My soul magnifies
the Lord. {1:47} And my spirit leaps for joy in God my
Saviour. {1:48} For he has looked with favor on the humility
of his handmaid. For behold, from this time, all generations
shall call me blessed. {1:49} For he who is great has done
great things for me, and holy is his name. {1:50} And his
mercy is from generation to generations for those who fear
him. {1:51} He has accomplished powerful deeds with his
arm. He has scattered the arrogant in the intentions of their
heart. {1:52} He has deposed the powerful from their seat,
and he has exalted the humble. {1:53} He has filled the
hungry with good things, and the rich he has sent away
empty. {1:54} He has taken up his servant Israel, mindful of
his mercy, {1:55} just as he spoke to our fathers: to Abraham
and to his offspring forever.”


)Night Prayer

[Psalm 24] (Psalm 25) {24:1} Unto the end. A Psalm of
David. To you, Lord, I have lifted up my soul. {24:2} In you,
my God, I trust. Let me not be put to shame. {24:3} And do
not let my enemies laugh at me. For all who remain with you
will not be confounded. {24:4} May all those who act
unjustly over nothing be confounded. O Lord, demonstrate
your ways to me, and teach me your paths. {24:5} Direct me
in your truth, and teach me. For you are God, my Saviour,
and I remain with you all day long. {24:6} O Lord,
remember your compassion and your mercies, which are
from ages past. {24:7} Do not remember the offenses of my
youth and my ignorances. Remember me according to your
mercy, because of your goodness, O Lord. {24:8} The Lord is
sweet and righteous. Because of this, he will grant a law to
those who fall short in the way. {24:9} He will direct the mild
in judgment. He will teach the meek his ways. {24:10} All
the ways of the Lord are mercy and truth, to those who yearn
for his covenant and his testimonies. {24:11} Because of your
name, O Lord, you will pardon my sin, for it is great.
{24:12} Which is the man who fears the Lord? He has
established a law for him, on the way that he has chosen.
{24:13} His soul will dwell upon good things, and his
offspring will inherit the earth. {24:14} The Lord is a
firmament to those who fear him, and his covenant will be
made manifest to them. {24:15} My eyes are ever toward the
Lord, for he will pull my feet from the snare. {24:16} Look
upon me and have mercy on me; for I am alone and poor.
{24:17} The troubles of my heart have been multiplied.
Deliver me from my needfulness. {24:18} See my lowliness
and my hardship, and release all my offenses.
{24:19} Consider my enemies, for they have been multiplied,
and they have hated me with an unjust hatred.
{24:20} Preserve my soul and rescue me. I will not be
ashamed, for I have hoped in you. {24:21} The innocent and
the righteous have adhered to me, because I have remained
with you. {24:22} Free Israel, O God, from all his
tribulations.


[Gospel Canticle] {2:29} “Now you may dismiss your servant in peace, O Lord,
according to your word. {2:30} For my eyes have seen your
salvation, {2:31} which you have prepared before the face of
all peoples: {2:32} the light of revelation to the nations and
the glory of your people Israel.”


]Wednesday 1

)Office of Readings

[Psalm 25] (Psalm 26) {25:1} Unto the end. A Psalm of
David. Judge me, Lord, for I have been walking in my
innocence, and by hoping in the Lord, I will not be weakened.
{25:2} Examine me, Lord, and test me: enkindle my
temperament and my heart. {25:3} For your mercy is before
my eyes, and I am serene in your truth. {25:4} I have not sat
with the council of emptiness, and I will not enter with those
who carry out injustice. {25:5} I have hated the assembly of
the malicious; and I will not sit with the impious. {25:6} I
will wash my hands among the innocent, and I will surround
your altar, O Lord, {25:7} so that I may hear the voice of
your praise and describe all your wonders. {25:8} O Lord, I
have loved the beauty of your house and the dwelling place
of your glory. {25:9} O God, do not let my soul perish with
the impious, nor my life with the men of blood, {25:10} in
whose hands are iniquities: their right hand has been filled by
bribes. {25:11} But as for me, I have been walking in my
innocence. Redeem me, and have mercy on me. {25:12} My
foot has stood firm in the straight path. In the churches, I will
bless you, O Lord.


[Psalm 26] (Psalm 27) {26:1} A Psalm of David, before he
was sealed. The Lord is my light and my salvation, whom
shall I fear? The Lord is the protector of my life, of whom
shall I be afraid? {26:2} Meanwhile, the guilty draw near to
me, so as to eat my flesh. Those who trouble me, my enemies,
have themselves been weakened and have fallen. {26:3} If
entrenched armies were to stand together against me, my
heart would not fear. If a battle were to rise up against me, I
would have hope in this. {26:4} One thing I have asked of the
Lord, this I will seek: that I may dwell in the house of the
Lord all the days of my life, so that I may behold the delight
of the Lord, and may visit his temple. {26:5} For he has
hidden me in his tabernacle. In the day of evils, he has
protected me in the hidden place of his tabernacle. {26:6} He
has exalted me upon the rock, and now he has exalted my
head above my enemies. I have circled around and offered a
sacrifice of loud exclamation in his tabernacle. I will sing,
and I will compose a psalm, to the Lord. {26:7} Hear my
voice, O Lord, with which I have cried out to you. Have
mercy on me, and hear me. {26:8} My heart has spoken to
you; my face has sought you. I yearn for your face, O Lord.
{26:9} Do not turn your face away from me. In your wrath,
do not turn aside from your servant. Be my helper. Do not
abandon me, and do not despise me, O God, my Saviour.
{26:10} For my father and my mother have left me behind,
but the Lord has taken me up. {26:11} O Lord, establish a
law for me in your way, and direct me in the right path,
because of my enemies. {26:12} Do not surrender me to the
souls of those who trouble me. For unjust witnesses have
risen up against me, and iniquity has lied to itself. {26:13} I
believe that I shall see the good things of the Lord in the land
of the living. {26:14} Wait for the Lord, act manfully; and let
your heart be strengthened, and remain with the Lord.


)Morning Prayer

[Psalm 27] (Psalm 28) {27:1} A Psalm of David himself. To
you, Lord, I will cry out. My God, do not be silent toward
me. For if you remain silent toward me, I will become like
those who descend into the pit. {27:2} Hear, O Lord, the
voice of my supplication, when I pray to you, when I lift up
my hands toward your holy temple. {27:3} Do not draw me
away together with sinners; and let me not perish with those
who work iniquity, who speak peacefully to their neighbor,
yet evils are in their hearts. {27:4} Give to them according to
their works and according to the wickedness of their
inventions. Assign to them according to the works of their
hands. Repay them with their own retribution. {27:5} Since
they have not understood the works of the Lord and the
works of his hands, you will destroy them, and you will not
build them up. {27:6} Blessed is the Lord, for he has heard
the voice of my supplication. {27:7} The Lord is my helper
and my protector. In him, my heart has hoped and I have
been helped. And my flesh has flourished again. And from
my will, I shall confess to him. {27:8} The Lord is the
strength of his people and the protector of the salvation of his
Christ. {27:9} O Lord, save your people and bless your
inheritance, and reign over them and exalt them, even unto
eternity.


[Psalm 28] (Psalm 29) {28:1} A Psalm of David, at the
completion of the tabernacle. Bring to the Lord, O sons of
God, bring to the Lord the sons of rams. {28:2} Bring to the
Lord, glory and honor. Bring to the Lord, glory for his name.
Adore the Lord in his holy court. {28:3} The voice of the
Lord is over the waters. The God of majesty has thundered.
The Lord is over many waters. {28:4} The voice of the Lord
is in virtue. The voice of the Lord is in magnificence.
{28:5} The voice of the Lord shatters the cedars. And the
Lord will shatter the cedars of Lebanon. {28:6} And it will
break them into pieces, like a calf of Lebanon, and in the
same way as the beloved son of the single-horned beast.
{28:7} The voice of the Lord cuts through the flame of fire.
{28:8} The voice of the Lord shakes the desert. And the Lord
will quake the desert of Kadesh. {28:9} The voice of the Lord
is preparing the stags, and he will reveal the dense woods.
And in his temple, all will speak his glory. {28:10} The Lord
causes the great flood to dwell. And the Lord will sit as King
in eternity. {28:11} The Lord will give virtue to his people.
The Lord will bless his people in peace.


[Gospel Canticle] {1:68} “Blessed is the Lord God of Israel. For he has
visited and has wrought the redemption of his people.
{1:69} And he has raised up a horn of salvation for us, in the
house of David his servant, {1:70} just as he spoke by the
mouth of his holy Prophets, who are from ages past:
{1:71} salvation from our enemies, and from the hand of all
those who hate us, {1:72} to accomplish mercy with our
fathers, and to call to mind his holy testament, {1:73} the
oath, which he swore to Abraham, our father, that he would
grant to us, {1:74} so that, having been freed from the hand
of our enemies, we may serve him without fear, {1:75} in
holiness and in justice before him, throughout all our days.
{1:76} And you, child, shall be called the prophet of the Most
High. For you will go before the face of the Lord: to prepare
his ways, {1:77} to give knowledge of salvation to his people
for the remission of their sins, {1:78} through the heart of the
mercy of our God, by which, descending from on high, he
has visited us, {1:79} to illuminate those who sit in darkness
and in the shadow of death, and to direct our feet in the way
of peace.”


)Midday Prayer

[Psalm 29] (Psalm 30) {29:1} A Canticle Psalm. In
dedication to the house of David. {29:2} I will extol you,
Lord, for you have sustained me, and you have not allowed
my enemies to delight over me. {29:3} O Lord my God, I
have cried out to you, and you have healed me. {29:4} Lord,
you led my soul away from Hell. You have saved me from
those who descend into the pit. {29:5} Sing a psalm to the
Lord, you his saints, and confess with remembrance of his
holiness. {29:6} For wrath is in his indignation, and life is in
his will. Toward evening, weeping will linger, and toward
morning, gladness. {29:7} But I have said in my abundance:
“I will never be disturbed.” {29:8} O Lord, in your will, you
made virtue preferable to beauty for me. You turned your
face away from me, and I became disturbed. {29:9} To you,
Lord, I will cry out. And I will make supplication to my God.
{29:10} What use would there be in my blood, if I descend
into corruption? Will dust confess to you or announce your
truth? {29:11} The Lord has heard, and he has been merciful
to me. The Lord has become my helper. {29:12} You have
turned my mourning into gladness for me. You have cut off
my sackcloth, and you have surrounded me with joy.
{29:13} So then, may my glory sing to you, and may I not
regret it. O Lord, my God, I will confess to you for eternity.


)Evening Prayer

[Psalm 30] (Psalm 31) {30:1} Unto the end. A Psalm of
David according to an ecstasy. {30:2} In you, Lord, I have
hoped; let me never be confounded. In your justice, deliver
me. {30:3} Incline your ear to me. Hasten to rescue me. Be
for me a protector God and a house of refuge, so as to
accomplish my salvation. {30:4} For you are my strength and
my refuge; and for the sake of your name, you will lead me
and nourish me. {30:5} You will lead me out of this snare,
which they have hidden for me. For you are my protector.
{30:6} Into your hands, I commend my spirit. You have
redeemed me, O Lord, God of truth. {30:7} You have hated
those who practice emptiness to no purpose. But I have
hoped in the Lord. {30:8} I will exult and rejoice in your
mercy. For you have looked upon my humility; you have
saved my soul from needfulness. {30:9} And you have not
enclosed me in the hands of the enemy. You have set my feet
in a spacious place. {30:10} Have mercy on me, Lord, for I
am troubled. My eye has been disturbed by wrath, along with
my soul and my gut. {30:11} For my life has fallen into
sorrow, and my years into sighing. My virtue has been
weakened in poverty, and my bones have been disturbed.
{30:12} I have become a disgrace among all my enemies, and
even more so to my neighbors, and a dread to my
acquaintances. Those who catch sight of me, flee away from
me. {30:13} I have become forgotten, like one dead to the
heart. I have become like a damaged utensil. {30:14} For I
have heard the harsh criticism of many who linger in the area.
While assembled together against me in that place, they
deliberated on how to take away my life. {30:15} But I have
hoped in you, O Lord. I said, “You are my God.”
{30:16} My fate is in your hands. Rescue me from the hand
of my enemies and from those who are persecuting me.
{30:17} Shine your face upon your servant. Save me in your
mercy. {30:18} Do not let me be confounded, Lord, for I
have called upon you. Let the impious be ashamed and be
drawn down into Hell. {30:19} May deceitful lips be silenced:
those that speak iniquity against the just, in arrogance and in
abusiveness. {30:20} How great is the multitude of your
sweetness, O Lord, which you keep hidden for those who
fear you, which you have perfected for those who hope in
you, in the sight of the sons of men. {30:21} You hide them
in the concealment of your face, from the disturbance of men.
You protect them in your tabernacle, from the contradiction
of tongues. {30:22} Blessed is the Lord. For he has shown his
wonderful mercy to me, in a fortified city. {30:23} But I said
in the excess of my mind: “I have been cast away from the
glance of your eyes.” And so, you heeded the voice of my
prayer, while I was still crying out to you. {30:24} Love the
Lord, all you his saints. For the Lord will require truth, and
he will abundantly repay those who act with arrogance.
{30:25} Act manfully, and let your heart be strengthened, all
you who hope in the Lord.


[Psalm 31] (Psalm 32) {31:1} The understanding of David
himself. Blessed are they whose iniquities have been forgiven
and whose sins have been covered. {31:2} Blessed is the man
to whom the Lord has not imputed sin, and in whose spirit
there is no deceit. {31:3} Because I was silent, my bones grew
old, while still I cried out all day long. {31:4} For, day and
night, your hand was heavy upon me. I have been converted
in my anguish, while still the thorn is piercing. {31:5} I have
acknowledged my offense to you, and I have not concealed
my injustice. I said, “I will confess against myself, my
injustice to the Lord,” and you forgave the impiety of my sin.
{31:6} For this, everyone who is holy will pray to you in due
time. Yet truly, in a flood of many waters, they will not draw
near to him. {31:7} You are my refuge from the tribulation
that has surrounded me. You are my exultation: rescue me
from those who are surrounding me. {31:8} I will give you
understanding, and I will instruct you in this way, in which
you will walk. I will fix my eyes upon you. {31:9} Do not
become like the horse and the mule, which have no
understanding. Their jaws are constrained with bit and bridle,
so as not to draw near to you. {31:10} Many are the scourges
of the sinner, but mercy will surround him that hopes in the
Lord. {31:11} Rejoice in the Lord and exult, you just ones,
and glory, all you upright of heart.


[Gospel Canticle} “My soul magnifies
the Lord. {1:47} And my spirit leaps for joy in God my
Saviour. {1:48} For he has looked with favor on the humility
of his handmaid. For behold, from this time, all generations
shall call me blessed. {1:49} For he who is great has done
great things for me, and holy is his name. {1:50} And his
mercy is from generation to generations for those who fear
him. {1:51} He has accomplished powerful deeds with his
arm. He has scattered the arrogant in the intentions of their
heart. {1:52} He has deposed the powerful from their seat,
and he has exalted the humble. {1:53} He has filled the
hungry with good things, and the rich he has sent away
empty. {1:54} He has taken up his servant Israel, mindful of
his mercy, {1:55} just as he spoke to our fathers: to Abraham
and to his offspring forever.”


)Night Prayer

[Psalm 32] (Psalm 33) {32:1} A Psalm of David. Exult in the
Lord, you just omnes; together praise the upright.
{32:2} Confess to the Lord with stringed instruments; sing
psalms to him with the psaltery, the instrument of ten strings.
{32:3} Sing to him a new song. Sing psalms to him skillfully,
with loud exclamation. {32:4} For the word of the Lord is
upright, and all his works are in faith. {32:5} He loves mercy
and judgment. The earth is full of the mercy of the Lord.
{32:6} By the word of the Lord, the heavens were established,
and all their power, by the Spirit of his mouth:
{32:7} gathering together the waters of the sea, as if in a
container, placing the depths in storage. {32:8} Let all the
earth fear the Lord, and may all the inhabitants of the world
quake before him. {32:9} For he spoke, and they became. He
commanded, and they were created. {32:10} The Lord
scatters the counsels of the nations. Moreover, he reproves
the thoughts of the people, and he rejects the counsels of the
leaders. {32:11} But the counsel of the Lord remains for
eternity, the thoughts of his heart from generation to
generation. {32:12} Blessed is the nation whose God is the
Lord, the people whom he has chosen as his inheritance.
{32:13} The Lord has looked down from heaven. He has
seen all the sons of men. {32:14} From his well-prepared
dwelling place, he has gazed upon all who dwell on the earth.
{32:15} He has formed the hearts of each one of them; he
understands all their works. {32:16} The king is not saved by
great power, nor will the giant be saved by his many powers.
{32:17} The horse is false safety; for he will not be saved by
the abundance of his powers. {32:18} Behold, the eyes of the
Lord are on those who fear him and on those who hope in his
mercy, {32:19} so as to rescue their souls from death and to
feed them during famine. {32:20} Our soul remains with the
Lord. For he is our helper and protector. {32:21} For in him,
our heart will rejoice, and in his holy name, we have hoped.
{32:22} Let your mercy be upon us, O Lord, just as we have
hoped in you.


[Gospel Canticle] {2:29} “Now you may dismiss your servant in peace, O Lord,
according to your word. {2:30} For my eyes have seen your
salvation, {2:31} which you have prepared before the face of
all peoples: {2:32} the light of revelation to the nations and
the glory of your people Israel.”

)Office of Readings

[Psalm 33] (Psalm 34) {33:1} To David, when he changed
his appearance in the sight of Abimelech, and so he dismissed
him, and he went away. {33:2} I will bless the Lord at all
times. His praise will be ever in my mouth. {33:3} In the
Lord, my soul will be praised. May the meek listen and
rejoice. {33:4} Magnify the Lord with me, and let us extol his
name in itself. {33:5} I sought the Lord, and he heeded me,
and he carried me away from all my tribulations.
{33:6} Approach him and be enlightened, and your faces will
not be confounded. {33:7} This poor one cried out, and the
Lord heeded him, and he saved him from all his tribulations.
{33:8} The Angel of the Lord will encamp around those who
fear him, and he will rescue them. {33:9} Taste and see that
the Lord is sweet. Blessed is the man who hopes in him.
{33:10} Fear the Lord, all you his saints. For there is no
destitution for those who fear him. {33:11} The rich have
been needy and hungry, but those who seek the Lord will not
be deprived of any good thing. {33:12} Come forward, sons.
Listen to me. I will teach you the fear of the Lord.
{33:13} Which is the man who wills life, who chooses to see
good days? {33:14} Prohibit your tongue from evil and your
lips from speaking deceit. {33:15} Turn away from evil, and
do good. Inquire about peace, and pursue it. {33:16} The
eyes of the Lord are on the just, and his ears are with their
prayers. {33:17} But the countenance of the Lord is upon
those who do evil, to perish the remembrance of them from
the earth. {33:18} The just cried out, and the Lord heard
them, and he freed them from all their tribulations.
{33:19} The Lord is near to those who are troubled in heart,
and he will save the humble in spirit. {33:20} Many are the
afflictions of the just, but from them all the Lord will free
them. {33:21} The Lord preserves all of their bones, not one
of them shall be broken. {33:22} The death of a sinner is very
harmful, and those who hate the just will fare badly.
{33:23} The Lord will redeem the souls of his servants, and
none of those who hope in him will fare badly.


[Psalm 34] (Psalm 35) {34:1} Of David himself. O Lord,
judge those who harm me; assail those who attack me.
{34:2} Take hold of weapons and a shield, and rise up in
assistance to me. {34:3} Bring forth the spear, and close in on
those who persecute me. Say to my soul, “I am your
salvation.” {34:4} Let them be confounded and in awe, who
pursue my soul. Let them be turned back and be confounded,
who think up evil against me. {34:5} May they become like
dust before the face of the wind, and let the Angel of the Lord
hem them in. {34:6} May their way become dark and
slippery, and may the Angel of the Lord pursue them.
{34:7} For, without cause, they have concealed their snare
for me unto destruction. Over nothing, they have rebuked my
soul. {34:8} Let the snare, of which he is ignorant, come
upon him, and let the deception, which he has hidden, take
hold of him: and may he fall into that very snare. {34:9} But
my soul will exult in the Lord and delight over his salvation.
{34:10} All my bones will say, “Lord, who is like you?” He
rescues the needy from the hand of the stronger one, the
indigent and the poor from those who plunder him.
{34:11} Unfair witnesses have risen up, interrogating me
about things of which I am ignorant. {34:12} They repaid me
evil for good, to the deprivation of my soul. {34:13} But as
for me, when they were harassing me, I was clothed with
haircloth. I humbled my soul with fasting, and my prayer will
become my sinews. {34:14} Like a neighbor, and like our
brother, so did I please; like one mourning and contrite, so
was I humbled. {34:15} And they have been joyful against
me, and they joined together. Scourges have been gathered
over me, and I was ignorant of it. {34:16} They have been
scattered, yet they were unremorseful. They have tested me.
They scoffed at me with scorn. They gnashed their teeth over
me. {34:17} Lord, when will you look down upon me?
Restore my soul from before their malice, my only one from
before the lions. {34:18} I will confess to you in a great
Church. I will praise you among a weighty people.
{34:19} May those who are my unjust adversaries not be glad
over me: those who have hated me without cause, and who
nod agreement with their eyes. {34:20} For indeed, they
spoke peacefully to me; and speaking with passion to the
earth, they intended deceit. {34:21} And they opened their
mouth wide over me. They said, “Well, well, our eyes have
seen.” {34:22} You have seen, O Lord, do not be silent. Lord,
do not depart from me. {34:23} Rise up and be attentive to
my judgment, to my cause, my God and my Lord.
{34:24} Judge me according to your justice, O Lord, my God,
and do not let them be glad over me. {34:25} Do not let them
say in their hearts, “Well, well, to our soul.” Neither let them
say, “We have devoured him.” {34:26} Let them blush and
be in awe together, those who congratulate at my misfortunes.
Let them be clothed with confusion and awe, who speak
great things against me. {34:27} Let them exult and rejoice,
who wish my justice, and let them ever say, “The Lord be
magnified,” who will the peace of his servant. {34:28} And
so my tongue will express your justice: your praise all day
long.


)Morning Prayer

[Psalm 35] (Psalm 36) {35:1} Unto the end. To the servant of
the Lord, David himself. {35:2} The unjust one has said
within himself that he would commit offenses. There is no
fear of God before his eyes. {35:3} For he has acted
deceitfully in his sight, such that his iniquity will be found to
be hatred. {35:4} The words of his mouth are iniquity and
deceit. He is unwilling to understand, so that he may act well.
{35:5} He has been considering iniquity on his bed. He has
set himself on every way that is not good; moreover, he has
not hated evil. {35:6} Lord, your mercy is in heaven, and
your truth is even to the clouds. {35:7} Your justice is like the
mountains of God. Your judgments are a great abyss. Men
and beasts, you will save, O Lord. {35:8} How you have
multiplied your mercy, O God! And so the sons of men will
hope under the cover of your wings. {35:9} They will be
inebriated with the fruitfulness of your house, and you will
give them to drink from the torrent of your enjoyment.
{35:10} For with you is the fountain of life; and within your
light, we will see the light. {35:11} Extend your mercy before
those who know you, and your justice to these, who are
upright in heart. {35:12} May arrogant feet not approach me,
and may the hand of the sinner not disturb me. {35:13} In
that place, those who work iniquity have fallen. They have
been expelled; they were not able to stand.


[Psalm 36] (Psalm 37) {36:1} A Psalm of David himself. Do
not choose to imitate the malicious; neither should you envy
those who work iniquity. {36:2} For they will quickly wither
away like dry grass, and in like manner to kitchen herbs, they
will soon droop. {36:3} Hope in the Lord and do good, and
dwell in the land, and so you shall be pastured with its riches.
{36:4} Delight in the Lord, and he will grant to you the
petitions of your heart. {36:5} Reveal your way to the Lord,
and hope in him, and he will accomplish it. {36:6} And he
will bring forth your justice like the light, and your judgment
like the midday. {36:7} Be subject to the Lord and pray to
him. Do not choose to compete with him who prospers in his
way, with the man who does injustice. {36:8} Cease from
wrath and leave behind rage. Do not choose to imitate the
malicious. {36:9} For those who are malicious will be
exterminated. But those who remain with the Lord, these will
inherit the land. {36:10} Yet still a little while, and the sinner
will not be. And you will search his place and find nothing.
{36:11} But the meek shall inherit the earth, and they will
delight in the multitude of peace. {36:12} The sinner will
observe the just, and he will gnash his teeth over him.
{36:13} But the Lord will laugh at him: for he knows in
advance that his day will come. {36:14} The sinners have
drawn the sword, they have bent their bow, so as to cast
down the poor and the needy, so as to massacre the upright
of heart. {36:15} Let their sword enter into their own hearts,
and let their bow be broken. {36:16} A little is better to the
just than the many riches of sinners. {36:17} For the arms of
sinners will be crushed, but the Lord confirms the just.
{36:18} The Lord knows the days of the immaculate, and
their inheritance will be in eternity. {36:19} They will not be
confounded in an evil time; and in days of famine, they will
be satisfied: {36:20} for sinners will perish. Truly, the
adversaries of the Lord, soon after they have been honored
and exalted, will fade away, in the same way that smoke
fades away. {36:21} The sinner will lend and not release, but
the just one shows compassion and donates. {36:22} For
those who bless him will inherit the earth, but those who
curse him will perish. {36:23} The steps of a man will be
directed by the Lord, and he will choose his way.
{36:24} When he falls, he will not be harmed, because the
Lord places his hand under him. {36:25} I have been young,
and now I am old; and I have not seen the just forsaken, nor
his offspring seeking bread. {36:26} He shows compassion
and lends, all day long, and his offspring will be in blessing.
{36:27} Turn away from evil and do good, and dwell forever
and ever. {36:28} For the Lord loves judgment, and he will
not abandon his saints. They will be kept safe in eternity. The
unjust will be punished, and the offspring of the impious will
perish. {36:29} But the just will inherit the earth, and they
will dwell upon it forever and ever. {36:30} The mouth of the
just one will express wisdom, and his tongue will speak
judgment. {36:31} The law of his God is in his heart, and his
steps shall not be supplanted. {36:32} The sinner considers
the just one and seeks to put him to death. {36:33} But the
Lord will not abandon him into his hands, nor condemn him,
when he will be judged. {36:34} Wait for the Lord, and keep
to his way. And he will exalt you, so as to inherit the land
that you may seize. When the sinners will have passed away,
then you shall see. {36:35} I have seen the impious over-
exalted, and lifted up like the cedars of Lebanon.
{36:36} And I passed by, and behold, he was not. And I
sought him, and his place was not found. {36:37} Keep to
innocence, and gaze upon fairness: because there are
allotments for the peaceful man. {36:38} But the unjust will
be destroyed together: the allotments of the impious will pass
away. {36:39} But the salvation of the just is from the Lord,
and he is their protector in time of tribulation. {36:40} And
the Lord will help them and free them. And he will rescue
them from sinners and save them, because they have hoped
in him.


[Gospel Canticle] {1:68} “Blessed is the Lord God of Israel. For he has
visited and has wrought the redemption of his people.
{1:69} And he has raised up a horn of salvation for us, in the
house of David his servant, {1:70} just as he spoke by the
mouth of his holy Prophets, who are from ages past:
{1:71} salvation from our enemies, and from the hand of all
those who hate us, {1:72} to accomplish mercy with our
fathers, and to call to mind his holy testament, {1:73} the
oath, which he swore to Abraham, our father, that he would
grant to us, {1:74} so that, having been freed from the hand
of our enemies, we may serve him without fear, {1:75} in
holiness and in justice before him, throughout all our days.
{1:76} And you, child, shall be called the prophet of the Most
High. For you will go before the face of the Lord: to prepare
his ways, {1:77} to give knowledge of salvation to his people
for the remission of their sins, {1:78} through the heart of the
mercy of our God, by which, descending from on high, he
has visited us, {1:79} to illuminate those who sit in darkness
and in the shadow of death, and to direct our feet in the way
of peace.”


)Midday Prayer

[Psalm 37] (Psalm 38) {37:1} A Psalm of David, in
commemoration of the Sabbath. {37:2} O Lord, do not
rebuke me in your fury, nor chastise me in your wrath.
{37:3} For your arrows have been driven into me, and your
hand has been confirmed over me. {37:4} There is no health
in my flesh before the face of your wrath. There is no peace
for my bones before the face of my sins. {37:5} For my
iniquities have walked over my head, and they have been like
a heavy burden weighing upon me. {37:6} My sores have
putrefied and been corrupted before the face of my
foolishness. {37:7} I have become miserable, and I have been
bent down, even to the end. I have walked with contrition all
day long. {37:8} For my loins have been filled with illusions,
and there is no health in my flesh. {37:9} I have been afflicted
and greatly humbled. I bellowed from the groaning of my
heart. {37:10} O Lord, all my desire is before you, and my
groaning before you has not been hidden. {37:11} My heart
has been disturbed. My strength has abandoned me, and the
light of my eyes has abandoned me, and it is not with me.
{37:12} My friends and my neighbors have drawn near and
stood against me. And those who were next to me stood far
apart. And those who sought my soul used violence.
{37:13} And those who sought evil accusations against me
were speaking emptiness. And they practiced deceitfulness all
day long. {37:14} But, like someone deaf, I did not hear. And
I was like someone mute, not opening his mouth.
{37:15} And I became like a man who does not hear, and
who has no reproofs in his mouth. {37:16} For in you, Lord,
I have hoped. You will listen to me, O Lord my God.
{37:17} For I said, “Lest at any time, my enemies might
rejoice over me,” and, “While my feet are being shaken, they
have spoken great things against me.” {37:18} For I have
been prepared for scourges, and my sorrow is ever before me.
{37:19} For I will announce my iniquity, and I will think
about my sin. {37:20} But my enemies live, and they have
been stronger than me. And those who have wrongfully hated
me have been multiplied. {37:21} Those who render evil for
good have dragged me down, because I followed goodness.
{37:22} Do not forsake me, O Lord my God. Do not depart
from me. {37:23} Be attentive to my help, O Lord, the God
of my salvation.


)Evening Prayer

[Psalm 38] (Psalm 39) {38:1} Unto the end. For Jeduthun
himself. A Canticle of David. {38:2} I said, “I will keep to
my ways, so that I will not offend with my tongue.” I posted
a guard at my mouth, when a sinner took up a position
against me. {38:3} I was silenced and humbled, and I was
quiet before good things, and my sorrow was renewed.
{38:4} My heart grew hot within me, and, during my
meditation, a fire would flare up. {38:5} I spoke with my
tongue, “O Lord, make me know my end, and what the
number of my days will be, so that I may know what is
lacking to me.” {38:6} Behold, you have made my days
measurable, and, before you, my substance is as nothing. Yet
truly, all things are vanity: every living man. {38:7} So then,
truly man passes by like an image; even so, he is disquieted in
vain. He stores up, and he knows not for whom he will gather
these things. {38:8} And now, what is it that awaits me? Is it
not the Lord? And my substance is with you. {38:9} Rescue
me from all my iniquities. You have handed me over as
reproach to the foolish. {38:10} I was silenced, and I did not
open my mouth, because it was you who acted.
{38:11} Remove your scourges from me. {38:12} I fall short
at corrections from the strength of your hand. For you have
chastised man for iniquity. And you have made his soul
shrink away like a spider. Nevertheless, it is in vain that any
man be disquieted. {38:13} O Lord, heed my prayer and my
supplication. Pay attention to my tears. Do not be silent. For
I am a newcomer with you, and a sojourner, just as all my
fathers were. {38:14} Forgive me, so that I may be refreshed,
before I will go forth and be no more.


[Psalm 39] (Psalm 40) {39:1} Unto the end. A Psalm of
David himself. {39:2} I have waited expectantly for the Lord,
and he was attentive to me. {39:3} And he heard my prayers
and he led me out of the pit of misery and the quagmire. And
he stationed my feet upon a rock, and he directed my steps.
{39:4} And he sent a new canticle into my mouth, a song to
our God. Many will see, and they will fear; and they will
hope in the Lord. {39:5} Blessed is the man whose hope is in
the name of the Lord, and who has no respect for vanities
and absurd falsehoods. {39:6} You have accomplished your
many wonders, O Lord my God, and there is no one similar
to you in your thoughts. I have announced and I have spoken:
they are multiplied beyond number. {39:7} Sacrifice and
oblation, you did not want. But you have perfected ears for
me. Holocaust and sin offering, you did not require.
{39:8} Then I said, “Behold, I draw near.” At the head of the
book, it has been written of me: {39:9} that I should do your
will. My God, I have willed it. And your law is in the midst
of my heart. {39:10} I have announced your justice in a great
Church: behold, I will not restrain my lips. O Lord, you have
known it. {39:11} I have not concealed your justice within
my heart. I have spoken your truth and your salvation. I have
not concealed your mercy and your truth from a great
assembly. {39:12} O Lord, do not take your tender mercies
far from me. Your mercy and your truth ever sustain me.
{39:13} For evils without number have surrounded me. My
iniquities have taken hold of me, and I was not able to see.
They have been multiplied beyond the hairs of my head. And
my heart has forsaken me. {39:14} Be pleased, O Lord, to
rescue me. Look down, O Lord, to help me. {39:15} Let
them together be confounded and awed, who seek after my
soul to steal it away. Let them be turned back and be in awe,
who wish evils upon me. {39:16} Let them bear their
confusion all at once, who say to me, “Well, well.”
{39:17} Let all who seek you exult and rejoice over you. And
let those who love your salvation always say, “May the Lord
be magnified.” {39:18} But I am a beggar and poor. The
Lord has been concerned about me. You are my helper and
my protector. My God, do not delay.


[Gospel Canticle} “My soul magnifies
the Lord. {1:47} And my spirit leaps for joy in God my
Saviour. {1:48} For he has looked with favor on the humility
of his handmaid. For behold, from this time, all generations
shall call me blessed. {1:49} For he who is great has done
great things for me, and holy is his name. {1:50} And his
mercy is from generation to generations for those who fear
him. {1:51} He has accomplished powerful deeds with his
arm. He has scattered the arrogant in the intentions of their
heart. {1:52} He has deposed the powerful from their seat,
and he has exalted the humble. {1:53} He has filled the
hungry with good things, and the rich he has sent away
empty. {1:54} He has taken up his servant Israel, mindful of
his mercy, {1:55} just as he spoke to our fathers: to Abraham
and to his offspring forever.”


)Night Prayer

[Psalm 40] (Psalm 41) {40:1} Unto the end. A Psalm of
David himself. {40:2} Blessed is he who shows
understanding toward the needy and the poor. The Lord will
deliver him in the evil day. {40:3} May the Lord preserve
him and give him life, and make him blessed upon the earth.
And may he not hand him over to the will of his adversaries.
{40:4} May the Lord bring him help on his bed of sorrow. In
his infirmity, you have changed his entire covering. {40:5} I
said, “O Lord, be merciful to me. Heal my soul, because I
have sinned against you.” {40:6} My enemies have spoken
evils against me. When will he die and his name perish?
{40:7} And when he came in to see me, he was speaking
emptiness. His heart gathered iniquity to itself. He went
outside, and he was speaking in the same way. {40:8} All my
enemies were whispering against me. They were thinking up
evils against me. {40:9} They established an unjust word
against me. Will he that sleeps no longer rise again?
{40:10} For even the man of my peace, in whom I hoped,
who ate my bread, has greatly supplanted me. {40:11} But
you, O Lord, have mercy on me, and raise me up again. And
I will requite them. {40:12} By this, I knew that you preferred
me: because my adversary will not rejoice over me.
{40:13} But you have sustained me, because of my innocence,
and you have confirmed me in your sight in eternity.
{40:14} Blessed is the Lord God of Israel, for all generations
and even forever. Amen. Amen.


[Gospel Canticle] {2:29} “Now you may dismiss your servant in peace, O Lord,
according to your word. {2:30} For my eyes have seen your
salvation, {2:31} which you have prepared before the face of
all peoples: {2:32} the light of revelation to the nations and
the glory of your people Israel.”


]Friday 1

)Office of Readings

[Psalm 41] (Psalm 42) {41:1} Unto the end. The
understanding of the sons of Korah. {41:2} As the deer longs
for fountains of water, so my soul longs for you, O God.
{41:3} My soul has thirsted for the strong living God. When
will I draw close and appear before the face of God?
{41:4} My tears have been my bread, day and night.
Meanwhile, it is said to me daily: “Where is your God?”
{41:5} These things I have remembered; and my soul within
me, I have poured out. For I will cross into the place of the
wonderful tabernacle, all the way to the house of God, with a
voice of exultation and confession, the sound of feasting.
{41:6} Why are you sad, my soul? And why do you disquiet
me? Hope in God, for I will still confess to him: the salvation
of my countenance, {41:7} and my God. My soul has been
troubled within myself. Because of this, I will remember you
from the land of the Jordan and from Hermon, from the little
mountain. {41:8} Abyss calls upon abyss, with the voice of
your floodgate. All your heights and your waves have passed
over me. {41:9} In the daylight, the Lord has ordered his
mercy; and in the night, a canticle to him. With me is a
prayer to the God of my life. {41:10} I will say to God, “You
are my supporter. Why have you forgotten me? And why do
I walk in mourning, while my adversary afflicts me?”
{41:11} While my bones are being broken, my enemies, who
trouble me, have reproached me. Meanwhile, they say to me
every single day, “Where is your God?” {41:12} My soul,
why are you saddened? And why do you disquiet me? Hope
in God, for I will still confess to him: the salvation of my
countenance and my God.


[Psalm 42] (Psalm 43) {42:1} A Psalm of David. Judge me,
O God, and discern my cause from that of a nation not holy;
rescue me from a man unjust and deceitful. {42:2} For you
are God, my strength. Why have you rejected me? And why
do I walk in sadness, while the adversary afflicts me?
{42:3} Send forth your light and your truth. They have
guided me and led me, to your holy mountain and into your
tabernacles. {42:4} And I will enter, up to the altar of God, to
God who enlivens my youthfulness. To you, O God, my God,
I will confess upon a stringed instrument. {42:5} Why are
you sad, my soul? And why do you disquiet me? Hope in
God, for I will still give praise to him: the salvation of my
countenance and my God.


)Morning Prayer

[Psalm 43] (Psalm 44) {43:1} Unto the end. To the sons of
Korah, toward understanding. {43:2} We have heard, O God,
with our own ears. Our fathers have announced to us the
work that you wrought in their days and in the days of
antiquity. {43:3} Your hand dispersed the Gentiles, and you
transplanted them. You afflicted a people, and you expelled
them. {43:4} For they did not take possession of the land by
their sword, and their own arm did not save them. But your
right hand and your arm, and the light of your countenance
did so, because you were pleased with them. {43:5} You
yourself are my king and my God, who commands the
salvation of Jacob. {43:6} With you, we will brandish a horn
before our enemies; and in your name, we will spurn those
rising up against us. {43:7} For I will not hope in my bow,
and my sword will not save me. {43:8} For you have saved
us from those who afflict us, and you have bewildered those
who hate us. {43:9} In God, we will give praise all day long;
and in your name, we will confess forever. {43:10} But now,
you have rejected and bewildered us, and you will not go
forth with our armies, O God. {43:11} You have turned our
back to our enemies, and those who hated us have plundered
for themselves. {43:12} You have given us over like sheep for
food. You have scattered us among the Gentiles.
{43:13} You have sold your people without a price, and no
great number was exchanged for them. {43:14} You have set
us as a disgrace to our neighbors, a scoff and a derision to
those who are around us. {43:15} You have set us as a
parable among the Gentiles, a shaking of the head among the
peoples. {43:16} All day long my shame is before me, and the
confusion of my face has covered me, {43:17} before the
voice of the reproacher and the commentator, before the face
of the adversary and the pursuer. {43:18} All these things
have come upon us, yet we have not forgotten you, and we
have not acted unjustly in your covenant. {43:19} And our
heart has not turned back. And you have not diverted our
steps from your way. {43:20} For you humbled us in a place
of affliction, and the shadow of death has covered us.
{43:21} If we have forgotten the name of our God, and if we
have extended our hands to a foreign god, {43:22} will not
God find this out? For he knows the secrets of the heart. For,
because of you, we are being killed all day long. We are
considered as sheep for the slaughter. {43:23} Rise up. Why
do you fall asleep, O Lord? Rise up, and do not reject us in
the end. {43:24} Why do you turn your face away, and why
do you forget our needfulness and our tribulation?
{43:25} For our soul has been humbled into the dust. Our
belly has been bound to the earth. {43:26} Rise up, O Lord.
Help us and redeem us, because of your name.


[Psalm 44] (Psalm 45) {44:1} Unto the end. For those who
will be changed. To the sons of Korah, toward understanding.
A Canticle for the Beloved. {44:2} My heart has uttered a
good word. I speak of my works to the king. My tongue is
like the pen of a scribe who writes quickly. {44:3} You are a
brilliant form before the sons of men. Grace has been poured
freely into your lips. Because of this, God has blessed you in
eternity. {44:4} Fasten your sword to your thigh, O most
powerful one. {44:5} With your splendor and your excellence
extended, proceed prosperously, and reign for the sake of
truth and meekness and justice, and so will your right hand
lead you wondrously. {44:6} Your arrows are sharp; the
people will fall under you, with the hearts of the enemies of
the king. {44:7} Your throne, O God, is forever and ever.
The scepter of your kingdom is a scepter of true aim.
{44:8} You have loved justice and hated iniquity. Because of
this, God, your God, has anointed you, before your co-heirs,
with the oil of gladness. {44:9} Myrrh and balsam and
cinnamon perfume your garments, from the houses of ivory.
From these, they have delighted you: {44:10} the daughters
of kings in your honor. The queen assisted at your right hand,
in clothing of gold, encircled with diversity. {44:11} Listen,
daughter, and see, and incline your ear. And forget your
people and your father’s house. {44:12} And the king will
desire your beauty. For he is the Lord your God, and they
will adore him. {44:13} And the daughters of Tyre will
entreat your countenance with gifts: all the rich men of the
people. {44:14} All the glory of the daughter of its king is
inside, in golden fringes, {44:15} clothed all around with
diversities. After her, virgins will be led to the king. Her
neighbors will be brought to you. {44:16} They will be
brought with gladness and exultation. They will be led into
the temple of the king. {44:17} For your fathers, sons have
been born to you. You will establish them as leaders over all
the earth. {44:18} They will remember your name always, for
generation after generation. Because of this, people will
confess to you in eternity, even forever and ever.


[Gospel Canticle] {1:68} “Blessed is the Lord God of Israel. For he has
visited and has wrought the redemption of his people.
{1:69} And he has raised up a horn of salvation for us, in the
house of David his servant, {1:70} just as he spoke by the
mouth of his holy Prophets, who are from ages past:
{1:71} salvation from our enemies, and from the hand of all
those who hate us, {1:72} to accomplish mercy with our
fathers, and to call to mind his holy testament, {1:73} the
oath, which he swore to Abraham, our father, that he would
grant to us, {1:74} so that, having been freed from the hand
of our enemies, we may serve him without fear, {1:75} in
holiness and in justice before him, throughout all our days.
{1:76} And you, child, shall be called the prophet of the Most
High. For you will go before the face of the Lord: to prepare
his ways, {1:77} to give knowledge of salvation to his people
for the remission of their sins, {1:78} through the heart of the
mercy of our God, by which, descending from on high, he
has visited us, {1:79} to illuminate those who sit in darkness
and in the shadow of death, and to direct our feet in the way
of peace.”


)Midday Prayer

[Psalm 45] (Psalm 46) {45:1} Unto the end. To the sons of
Korah, for confidants. A Psalm. {45:2} Our God is our
refuge and strength, a helper in the tribulations that have
greatly overwhelmed us. {45:3} Because of this, we will not
be afraid when the earth will be turbulent and the mountains
will be transferred into the heart of the sea. {45:4} They
thundered, and the waters were stirred up among them; the
mountains have been disturbed by his strength. {45:5} The
frenzy of the river rejoices the city of God. The Most High
has sanctified his tabernacle. {45:6} God is in its midst; it will
not be shaken. God will assist it in the early morning.
{45:7} The peoples have been disturbed, and the kingdoms
have been bowed down. He uttered his voice: the earth has
been moved. {45:8} The Lord of hosts is with us. The God of
Jacob is our supporter. {45:9} Draw near and behold the
works of the Lord: what portents he has set upon the earth,
{45:10} carrying away wars even to the end of the earth. He
will crush the bow and break the weapons, and he will burn
the shield with fire. {45:11} Be empty, and see that I am God.
I will be exalted among the peoples, and I will be exalted
upon the earth. {45:12} The Lord of hosts is with us. The
God of Jacob is our supporter.


)Evening Prayer

[Psalm 46] (Psalm 47) {46:1} Unto the end. A Psalm for the
sons of Korah. {46:2} All nations, clap your hands. Shout
joyfully to God with a voice of exultation. {46:3} For the
Lord is exalted and terrible: a great King over all the earth.
{46:4} He has subjected the peoples to us and subdued the
nations under our feet. {46:5} He has chosen us for his
inheritance: the splendor of Jacob, whom he has loved.
{46:6} God ascends with jubilation, and the Lord with the
voice of the trumpet. {46:7} Sing psalms to our God, sing
psalms. Sing psalms to our King, sing psalms. {46:8} For
God is the King of all the earth. Sing psalms wisely.
{46:9} God will reign over the peoples. God sits upon his
holy throne. {46:10} The leaders of the peoples have been
gathered together by the God of Abraham. For the strong
gods of the earth have been exceedingly exalted.


[Psalm 47] (Psalm 48) {47:1} A Canticle Psalm. To the sons
of Korah, on the second Sabbath. {47:2} The Lord is great
and exceedingly praiseworthy, in the city of our God, on his
holy mountain. {47:3} Mount Zion is being founded with the
exultation of the whole earth, on the north side, the city of
the great king. {47:4} In her houses, God will be known,
since he will support her. {47:5} For behold, the kings of the
earth have been gathered together; they have convened as
one. {47:6} Such did they see, and they were astonished: they
were disturbed, they were moved. {47:7} Trembling took
hold of them. In that place, their pains were that of a woman
in labor. {47:8} With a vehement spirit, you will crush the
ships of Tarshish. {47:9} As we have heard, so we have seen,
in the city of the Lord of hosts, in the city of our God. God
has founded it in eternity. {47:10} We have received your
mercy, O God, in the midst of your temple.
{47:11} According to your name, O God, so does your praise
reach to the ends of the earth. Your right hand is full of
justice. {47:12} Let mount Zion rejoice, and let the daughters
of Judah exult, because of your judgments, O Lord.
{47:13} Encircle Zion and embrace her. Discourse in her
towers. {47:14} Set your hearts on her virtue. And distribute
her houses, so that you may discourse of it in another
generation. {47:15} For this is God, our God, in eternity and
forever and ever. He will rule us forever.


[Gospel Canticle} “My soul magnifies
the Lord. {1:47} And my spirit leaps for joy in God my
Saviour. {1:48} For he has looked with favor on the humility
of his handmaid. For behold, from this time, all generations
shall call me blessed. {1:49} For he who is great has done
great things for me, and holy is his name. {1:50} And his
mercy is from generation to generations for those who fear
him. {1:51} He has accomplished powerful deeds with his
arm. He has scattered the arrogant in the intentions of their
heart. {1:52} He has deposed the powerful from their seat,
and he has exalted the humble. {1:53} He has filled the
hungry with good things, and the rich he has sent away
empty. {1:54} He has taken up his servant Israel, mindful of
his mercy, {1:55} just as he spoke to our fathers: to Abraham
and to his offspring forever.”


)Night Prayer

[Psalm 48] (Psalm 49) {48:1} Unto the end. A Psalm to the
sons of Korah. {48:2} Hear these things, all nations. Pay
attention, all inhabitants of the world: {48:3} whoever is
earth-born, you sons of men, together as one, the rich and the
poor. {48:4} My mouth will speak wisdom, and the
meditation of my heart will speak prudence. {48:5} I will
incline my ear to a parable. I will open my case with the
psaltery. {48:6} Why should I fear in the evil day? The
iniquity at my heel will surround me. {48:7} Those who trust
in their own strength and who glory in the multitude of their
riches, {48:8} no brother redeems, nor will man buy back. He
will not give to God his appeasement, {48:9} nor the price for
the redemption of his soul. And he will labor continuously,
{48:10} and he will still live, until the end. {48:11} He will
not see death, when he sees the wise dying: the foolish and
the senseless will perish together. And they will leave their
riches to strangers. {48:12} And their sepulchers will be their
houses forever, their tabernacles from generation to
generation. They have called their names in their own lands.
{48:13} And man, when he was held in honor, did not
understand. He has been compared to the senseless beasts,
and he has become like them. {48:14} This way of theirs is a
scandal to them. And afterwards, they will delight in their
mouth. {48:15} They have been placed in Hell like sheep.
Death will feed on them. And the just will have dominion
over them in the morning. And their help will grow old in
Hell for their glory. {48:16} Even so, truly God will redeem
my soul from the hand of Hell, when he will receive me.
{48:17} Do not be afraid, when a man will have been made
rich, and when the glory of his house will have been
multiplied. {48:18} For when he dies, he will take nothing
away, and his glory will not descend with him. {48:19} For
his soul will be blessed in his lifetime, and he will admit to
you when you do good to him. {48:20} He will even enter
with the progeny of his fathers, but, even in eternity, he will
not see the light. {48:21} Man, when he was in honor, did
not understand. He has been compared to the senseless beasts,
and he has become like them.


[Gospel Canticle] {2:29} “Now you may dismiss your servant in peace, O Lord,
according to your word. {2:30} For my eyes have seen your
salvation, {2:31} which you have prepared before the face of
all peoples: {2:32} the light of revelation to the nations and
the glory of your people Israel.”

)Office of Readings

[Psalm 49] (Psalm 50) {49:1} A Psalm of Asaph. The God of
gods, the Lord has spoken, and he has called the earth, from
the rising of the sun even to its setting, {49:2} from Zion, the
brilliance of his beauty. {49:3} God will arrive manifestly.
Our God also will not keep silence. A fire will flare up in his
sight, and a mighty tempest will surround him. {49:4} He
will call to heaven from above, and to the earth, to discern his
people. {49:5} Gather his holy ones to him, you who order
his covenant above sacrifices. {49:6} And the heavens will
announce his justice. For God is the judge. {49:7} Listen, my
people, and I will speak. Listen, Israel, and I will testify for
you. I am God, your God. {49:8} I will not reprove you for
your sacrifices. Moreover, your holocausts are ever in my
sight. {49:9} I will not accept calves from your house, nor he-
goats from your flocks. {49:10} For all the wild beasts of the
forest are mine: the cattle on the hills and the oxen. {49:11} I
know all the flying things of the air, and the beauty of the
field is with me. {49:12} If I should be hungry, I would not
tell you: for the whole world is mine, and all its plentitude.
{49:13} Shall I gnaw on the flesh of bulls? Or would I drink
the blood of goats? {49:14} Offer to God the sacrifice of
praise, and pay your vows to the Most High. {49:15} And
call upon me in the day of tribulation. I will rescue you, and
you will honor me. {49:16} But to the sinner, God has said:
Why do you discourse on my justices, and take up my
covenant through your mouth? {49:17} Truly, you have
hated discipline, and you have cast my sermons behind you.
{49:18} If you saw a thief, you ran with him, and you have
placed your portion with adulterers. {49:19} Your mouth has
abounded with malice, and your tongue has concocted
deceits. {49:20} Sitting, you spoke against your brother, and
you set up a scandal against your mother’s son.
{49:21} These things you have done, and I was silent. You
thought, unjustly, that I ought to be like you. But I will
reprove you, and I will set myself against your face.
{49:22 Understand these things, you who forget God; lest at
any time, he might quickly take you away, and there would
be no one to rescue you. {49:23} The sacrifice of praise will
honor me. And in that place is the journey by which I will
reveal to him the salvation of God.


[Psalm 50] (Psalm 51) {50:1} Unto the end. A Psalm of
David, {50:2} when Nathan the prophet came to him, after
he went to Bathsheba. {50:3} Be merciful to me, O God,
according to your great mercy. And, according to the
plentitude of your compassion, wipe out my iniquity.
{50:4} Wash me once again from my iniquity, and cleanse
me from my sin. {50:5} For I know my iniquity, and my sin
is ever before me. {50:6} Against you only have I sinned, and
I have done evil before your eyes. And so, you are justified in
your words, and you will prevail when you give judgment.
{50:7} For behold, I was conceived in iniquities, and in
sinfulness did my mother conceive me. {50:8} For behold,
you have loved truth. The obscure and hidden things of your
wisdom, you have manifested to me. {50:9} You will
sprinkle me with hyssop, and I will be cleansed. You will
wash me, and I will be made whiter than snow. {50:10} In
my hearing, you will grant gladness and rejoicing. And the
bones that have been humbled will exult. {50:11} Turn your
face away from my sins, and erase all my iniquities.
{50:12} Create a clean heart in me, O God. And renew an
upright spirit within my inmost being. {50:13} Do not cast
me away from your face; and do not take your Holy Spirit
from me. {50:14} Restore to me the joy of your salvation,
and confirm me with an unsurpassed spirit. {50:15} I will
teach the unjust your ways, and the impious will be
converted to you. {50:16} Free me from blood, O God, the
God of my salvation, and my tongue will extol your justice.
{50:17} O Lord, you will open my lips, and my mouth will
announce your praise. {50:18} For if you had desired
sacrifice, I would certainly have given it, but with holocausts,
you will not be delighted. {50:19} A crushed spirit is a
sacrifice to God. A contrite and humbled heart, O God, you
will not spurn. {50:20} Act kindly, Lord, in your good will
toward Zion, so that the walls of Jerusalem may be built up.
{50:21} Then you will accept the sacrifice of justice, oblations,
and holocausts. Then they will lay calves upon your altar.


)Morning Prayer

[Psalm 51] (Psalm 52) {51:1} Unto the end. The
understanding of David. {51:2} When Doeg the Edomite
came and reported to Saul, David went to the house of
Ahimelech. {51:3} Why do you glory in malice, you who are
powerful in iniquity? {51:4} All day long your tongue thinks
up injustice. Like a sharp razor, you have wrought deceit.
{51:5} You have loved malice above goodness, and iniquity
more than speaking righteousness. {51:6} You have loved all
precipitous words, you deceitful tongue. {51:7} Because of
this, God will destroy you in the end. He will pull you up,
and he will remove you from your tabernacle and your root
from the land of the living. {51:8} The just will see and be
afraid, and they will laugh over him, and say: {51:9} “Behold
the man who did not set God as his helper. But he hoped in
the multitude of his riches, and so he prevailed in his
emptiness.” {51:10} But I, like a fruitful olive tree in the
house of God, have hoped in the mercy of God unto eternity,
and forever and ever. {51:11} I will confess to you forever,
because you have accomplished it. And I will wait on your
name, for it is good in the sight of your saints.


[Psalm 52] (Psalm 53) {52:1} Unto the end. For Mahalath:
the thoughts of David. The fool has said in his heart, “There
is no God.” {52:2} They were corrupted, and they became
abominable with iniquities. There is no one who does good.
{52:3} God gazed down from heaven on the sons of men, to
see if there were any who were considering or seeking God.
{52:4} All have gone astray; together they have become
useless. There is no one who does good; there is not even one.
{52:5} Will they never learn: all those who work iniquity,
who devour my people like a meal of bread? {52:6} They
have not called upon God. In that place, they have trembled
in fear, where there was no fear. For God has scattered the
bones of those who please men. They have been confounded,
because God has spurned them. {52:7} Who will grant from
Zion the salvation of Israel? Jacob will exult, when God will
convert the captivity of his people; and Israel will rejoice.


[Gospel Canticle] {1:68} “Blessed is the Lord God of Israel. For he has
visited and has wrought the redemption of his people.
{1:69} And he has raised up a horn of salvation for us, in the
house of David his servant, {1:70} just as he spoke by the
mouth of his holy Prophets, who are from ages past:
{1:71} salvation from our enemies, and from the hand of all
those who hate us, {1:72} to accomplish mercy with our
fathers, and to call to mind his holy testament, {1:73} the

grant to us, {1:74} so that, having been freed from the hand

holiness and in justice before him, throughout all our days.
{1:76} And you, child, shall be called the prophet of the Most
High. For you will go before the face of the Lord: to prepare
his ways, {1:77} to give knowledge of salvation to his people
for the remission of their sins, {1:78} through the heart of the
mercy of our God, by which, descending from on high, he
has visited us, {1:79} to illuminate those who sit in darkness
and in the shadow of death, and to direct our feet in the way
of peace.”


)Midday Prayer

[Psalm 53] (Psalm 54) {53:1} Unto the end. In verses, the
understanding of David, {53:2} when the Ziphites had
arrived and they said to Saul, “Has not David been hidden
with us?” {53:3} Save me, O God, by your name, and judge
me in your virtue. {53:4} O God, listen to my prayer. Pay
attention to the words of my mouth. {53:5} For strangers
have risen up against me, and the strong have sought my soul.
And they have not set God before their eyes. {53:6} For
behold, God is my helper, and the Lord is the protector of my
soul. {53:7} Turn back the evils upon my adversaries, and
ruin them by your truth. {53:8} I will freely sacrifice to you,
and I will confess your name, O God, because it is good.
{53:9} For you have quickly rescued me from all tribulation,
and my eye has looked down upon my enemies.


)Evening Prayer

[Psalm 54] (Psalm 55) {54:1} Unto the end. In verses, the
understanding of David. {54:2} Listen to my prayer, O God,
and despise not my supplication. {54:3} Be attentive to me,
and heed me. I have been grieved in my training, and I have
been disturbed {54:4} at the voice of the adversary and at the
tribulation of the sinner. For they have diverted iniquities
toward me, and they have been harassing me with rage.
{54:5} My heart has become disturbed within me, and the
dread of death has fallen over me. {54:6} Fear and trembling
have overwhelmed me, and darkness has buried me.
{54:7} And I said, “Who will give me wings like the dove, so
that I may fly away and take rest?” {54:8} Behold, I have fled
far away, and I linger in solitude. {54:9} I waited for him
who saved me from a weak-minded spirit and from a tempest.
{54:10} Cast them down, O Lord, and divide their tongues.
For I have seen iniquity and contradiction in the city.
{54:11} Day and night, iniquity will surround it upon its
walls, and hardship is in its midst, {54:12} with injustice.
And usury and deceit have not fallen away from its streets.
{54:13} For if my enemy had spoken evil about me, certainly,
I would have sustained it. And if he who hated me had been
speaking great things against me, I would perhaps have
hidden myself from him. {54:14} Truly, you are a man of one
mind: my leader and my acquaintance, {54:15} who took
sweet food together with me. In the house of God, we walked
side-by-side. {54:16} Let death come upon them, and let
them descend alive into Hellfire. For there is wickedness in
their dwellings, in their midst. {54:17} But I have cried out to
God, and the Lord will save me. {54:18} Evening and
morning and midday, I will discourse and announce, and he
will heed my voice. {54:19} He will redeem my soul in peace
from those who draw near to me. For, among the many, they
were with me. {54:20} God will hear, and He who is before
time will humble them. For there is no change with them,
and they have not feared God. {54:21} He has stretched forth
his hand in retribution. They have contaminated his covenant.
{54:22} They were divided by the wrath of his countenance,
and his heart has drawn near. His words are smoother than
oil, and they are arrows. {54:23} Cast your cares upon the
Lord, and he will nurture you. He will not allow the just to be
tossed about forever. {54:24} Truly, O God, you will lead
them away into the well of death. Bloody and deceitful men
will not divide their days in half. But I will hope in you, O
Lord.


[Psalm 55] (Psalm 56) {55:1} Unto the end. For the people
who have become far removed from the Sacred. Of David,
with the inscription of a title, when the Philistines held him in
Gath. {55:2} Have mercy on me, O God, because man has
trampled over me. All day long, he has afflicted me by
fighting against me. {55:3} My enemies have trampled over
me all day long. For those who make war against me are
many. {55:4} From the height of the day, I will be afraid. But
truly, I will hope in you. {55:5} In God, I will praise my
words. In God, I have put my trust. I will not fear what flesh
can do to me. {55:6} All day long, they curse my words. All
their intentions are for evil against me. {55:7} They will
dwell and hide themselves. They will watch my heel, just as
they waited for my soul; {55:8} because of this, nothing will
save them. In your anger, you will crush the people. {55:9} O
God, I have announced my life to you. You have placed my
tears in your sight, and even in your promise. {55:10} Then
my enemies will be turned back. On whatever day that I call
upon you, behold, I know that you are my God. {55:11} In
God, I will praise the word. In the Lord, I will praise his
speech. In God, I have hoped. I will not fear what man can
do to me. {55:12} My vows to you, O God, are in me. I will
repay them. Praises be to you. {55:13} For you have rescued
my soul from death and my feet from slipping, so that I may
be pleasing in the sight of God, in the light of the living.


[Gospel Canticle} “My soul magnifies
the Lord. {1:47} And my spirit leaps for joy in God my
Saviour. {1:48} For he has looked with favor on the humility
of his handmaid. For behold, from this time, all generations
shall call me blessed. {1:49} For he who is great has done
great things for me, and holy is his name. {1:50} And his
mercy is from generation to generations for those who fear
him. {1:51} He has accomplished powerful deeds with his
arm. He has scattered the arrogant in the intentions of their
heart. {1:52} He has deposed the powerful from their seat,
and he has exalted the humble. {1:53} He has filled the
hungry with good things, and the rich he has sent away
empty. {1:54} He has taken up his servant Israel, mindful of
his mercy, {1:55} just as he spoke to our fathers: to Abraham
and to his offspring forever.”


)Night Prayer

[Psalm 56] (Psalm 57) {56:1} Unto the end. May you not
destroy. Of David, with the inscription of a title, when he fled
from Saul into a cave. {56:2} Be merciful to me, O God, be
merciful to me. For my soul trusts in you. And I will hope in
the shadow of your wings, until iniquity passes away.
{56:3} I will cry out to God Most High, to God who has been
kind to me. {56:4} He sent from heaven and freed me. He
has surrendered into disgrace those who trampled me. God
has sent his mercy and his truth. {56:5} And he has rescued
my soul from the midst of the young lions. I slept troubled.
The sons of men: their teeth are weapons and arrows, and
their tongue is a sharp sword. {56:6} Be exalted above the
heavens, O God, and your glory above all the earth.
{56:7} They prepared a snare for my feet, and they bowed
down my soul. They dug a pit before my face, yet they have
fallen into it. {56:8} My heart is prepared, O God, my heart
is prepared. I will sing, and I will compose a psalm.
{56:9} Rise up, my glory. Rise up, psaltery and harp. I will
arise in early morning. {56:10} I will confess to you, O Lord,
among the peoples. I will compose a psalm to you among the
nations. {56:11} For your mercy has been magnified, even to
the heavens, and your truth, even to the clouds. {56:12} Be
exalted above the heavens, O God, and your glory above all
the earth.


[Gospel Canticle] {2:29} “Now you may dismiss your servant in peace, O Lord,
according to your word. {2:30} For my eyes have seen your
salvation, {2:31} which you have prepared before the face of
all peoples: {2:32} the light of revelation to the nations and
the glory of your people Israel.”


>Week 2

]Sunday 2

)Office of Readings

[Psalm 57] (Psalm 58) {57:1} Unto the end. May you not
destroy. Of David, with the inscription of a title. {57:2} If,
truly and certainly, you speak justice, then judge what is right,
you sons of men. {57:3} For, even in your heart, you work
iniquity. Your hands construct injustice on the earth.
{57:4} Sinners have become foreigners from the womb; they
have gone astray from conception. They have been speaking
falsehoods. {57:5} Their fury is similar to that of a serpent; it
is like a deaf asp, who even blocks her ears, {57:6} who will
not listen to the voice of charmers, nor even to the enchanter
who chants wisely. {57:7} God will crush their teeth within
their own mouth. The Lord will break the molars of the lions.
{57:8} They will come to nothing, like water flowing away.
He has aimed his bow, while they are being weakened.
{57:9} Like wax that flows, they will be carried away. Fire
has fallen upon them, and they will not see the sun.
{57:10} Before your thorns could know the brier, he
consumes them alive, as if in rage. {57:11} The just one will
rejoice when he sees vindication. He will wash his hands in
the blood of the sinner. {57:12} And man will say, “If the just
one is fruitful, then, truly, there is a God judging them on
earth.”


[Psalm 58] (Psalm 59) {58:1} Unto the end. May you not
destroy. Of David, with the inscription of a title, when Saul
sent and watched his house, in order to execute him.
{58:2} Rescue me from my enemies, my God, and free me
from those who rise up against me. {58:3} Rescue me from
those who work iniquity, and save me from men of blood.
{58:4} For behold, they have seized my soul. The strong have
rushed upon me. {58:5} And it is neither my iniquity, nor my
sin, O Lord. I have run and gone directly, without iniquity.
{58:6} Rise up to meet me, and see: even you, O Lord, the
God of hosts, the God of Israel. Reach out to visit all nations.
Do not take pity on all those who work iniquity. {58:7} They
will return toward evening, and they will suffer hunger like
dogs, and they will wander around the city. {58:8} Behold,
they will speak with their mouth, and a sword is in their lips:
“For who has heard us?” {58:9} And you, O Lord, will laugh
at them. You will lead all the Gentiles to nothing. {58:10} I
will guard my strength toward you, for you are God, my
supporter. {58:11} My God, his mercy will precede me.
{58:12} God will oversee my enemies for me. Do not slay
them, lest at times my people may forget them. Scatter them
by your virtue. And depose them, O Lord, my protector,
{58:13} by the offense of their mouth and by the speech of
their lips. And may they be caught in their arrogance. And,
for their cursing and lying, they will be made known
{58:14} at the consummation, in the fury of the
consummation, and so they will be no more. And they will
know that God will rule over Jacob, even to the ends of the
earth. {58:15} They will return toward evening, and they will
suffer hunger like dogs, and they will wander around the city.
{58:16} They will be dispersed in order to gnaw, and truly,
when they will not have been satisfied, they will murmur.
{58:17} But I will sing your strength, and I will extol your
mercy, in the morning. For you have been my supporter and
my refuge in the day of my tribulation. {58:18} To you, my
helper, I will sing psalms. For you are God, my supporter.
My God is my mercy.


)Morning Prayer

[Psalm 59] (Psalm 60) {59:1} Unto the end. For those who
will be changed, with the inscription of a title, of David
himself, for instruction: {59:2} when he set fire to
Mesopotamia of Syria and Sobal, and Joab turned back and
struck Idumea, in the valley of the salt pits, twelve thousand
men. {59:3} O God, you have rejected us, and you have
ruined us. You became angry, and yet you have been
merciful to us. {59:4} You have moved the earth, and you
have disturbed it. Heal its breaches, for it has been moved.
{59:5} You have revealed to your people difficulties. You
have made us drink the wine of remorse. {59:6} You have
given a warning sign to those who fear you, so that they may
flee from before the face of the bow, so that your beloved
may be delivered. {59:7} Save me with your right hand, and
hear me. {59:8} God has spoken in his holy place: I will
rejoice, and I will divide Shechem, and I will measure the
steep valley of the tabernacles. {59:9} Gilead is mine, and
Manasseh is mine. And Ephraim is the strength of my head.
Judah is my king. {59:10} Moab is the cooking pot of my
hope. Into Idumea, I will extend my shoe. To me, the
foreigners have been made subject. {59:11} Who will lead me
into the fortified city? Who will lead me all the way to
Idumea? {59:12} Will not you, O God, who has rejected us?
And will not you, O God, go out with our armies?
{59:13} Grant us help from tribulation. For salvation from
man is empty. {59:14} In God, we will act virtuously. And
those who trouble us, he will lead to nothing.


[Psalm 60] (Psalm 61) {60:1} Unto the end. With hymns, of
David. {60:2} O God, pay attention to my supplication. Be
attentive to my prayer. {60:3} I cried out to you from the
ends of the earth. When my heart was in anguish, you
exalted me on a rock. You have led me, {60:4} for you have
been my hope, a tower of strength before the face of the
enemy. {60:5} I will dwell in your tabernacle forever. I will
be protected under the cover of your wings. {60:6} For you,
my God, have listened to my prayer. You have granted an
inheritance to those who fear your name. {60:7} You will
add days to the days of the king, to his years, even to the time
of generation after generation. {60:8} He remains in eternity,
in the sight of God. Who will long for his mercy and truth?
{60:9} So I will compose a psalm to your name, forever and
ever, so that I may repay my vows from day to day.


[Gospel Canticle] {1:68} “Blessed is the Lord God of Israel. For he has
visited and has wrought the redemption of his people.
{1:69} And he has raised up a horn of salvation for us, in the
house of David his servant, {1:70} just as he spoke by the
mouth of his holy Prophets, who are from ages past:
{1:71} salvation from our enemies, and from the hand of all
those who hate us, {1:72} to accomplish mercy with our
fathers, and to call to mind his holy testament, {1:73} the
oath, which he swore to Abraham, our father, that he would
grant to us, {1:74} so that, having been freed from the hand
of our enemies, we may serve him without fear, {1:75} in
holiness and in justice before him, throughout all our days.
{1:76} And you, child, shall be called the prophet of the Most
High. For you will go before the face of the Lord: to prepare
his ways, {1:77} to give knowledge of salvation to his people
for the remission of their sins, {1:78} through the heart of the
mercy of our God, by which, descending from on high, he
has visited us, {1:79} to illuminate those who sit in darkness
and in the shadow of death, and to direct our feet in the way
of peace.”


)Midday Prayer

[Psalm 61] (Psalm 62) {61:1} Unto the end. For Jeduthun. A
Psalm of David. {61:2} Will my soul not be subject to God?
For from him is my salvation. {61:3} Yes, he himself is my
God and my salvation. He is my supporter; I will be moved
no more. {61:4} How is it that you rush against a man? Every
one of you puts to death, as if you were pulling down a
ruined wall, leaning over and falling apart. {61:5} So, truly,
they intended to reject my price. I ran in thirst. They blessed
with their mouth and cursed with their heart. {61:6} Yet,
truly, my soul will be subject to God. For from him is my
patience. {61:7} For he is my God and my Savior. He is my
helper; I will not be expelled. {61:8} In God is my salvation
and my glory. He is the God of my help, and my hope is in
God. {61:9} All peoples gathered together: trust in him. Pour
out your hearts in his sight. God is our helper for eternity.
{61:10} So, truly, the sons of men are untrustworthy. The
sons of men are liars in the scales, so that, by emptiness, they
may deceive among themselves. {61:11} Do not trust in
iniquity, and do not desire plunder. If riches flow toward you,
do not be willing to set your heart on them. {61:12} God has
spoken once. I have heard two things: that power belongs to
God, {61:13} and that mercy belongs to you, O Lord. For
you will repay each one according to his works.


)Evening Prayer

[Psalm 62] (Psalm 63) {62:1} A Psalm of David, when he
was in the desert of Idumea. {62:2} O God, my God: to you,
I keep vigil until first light. For you, my soul has thirsted, to
you my body, in so many ways. {62:3} By a deserted land,
both inaccessible and waterless, so I have appeared in the
sanctuary before you, in order to behold your virtue and your
glory. {62:4} For your mercy is better than life itself. It is you
my lips will praise. {62:5} So will I bless you in my life, and I
will lift up my hands in your name. {62:6} Let my soul be
filled, as if with marrow and fatness; and my mouth will give
praise with exultant lips. {62:7} When I have remembered
you on my bed in the morning, I will meditate on you.
{62:8} For you have been my helper. And I will exult under
the cover of your wings. {62:9} My soul has clung close to
you. Your right hand has supported me. {62:10} Truly, these
ones have sought my soul in vain. They will enter into the
lower parts of the earth. {62:11} They will be delivered into
the hand of the sword. They will be the portions of foxes.
{62:12} Truly, the king will rejoice in God: all those who
swear by him will be praised, because the mouth of those
who speak iniquity has been blocked.


[Psalm 63] (Psalm 64) {63:1} Unto the end. A Psalm of
David. {63:2} Hear, O God, my prayer of supplication.
Rescue my soul from the fear of the enemy. {63:3} You have
protected me from the assembly of the malignant, from a
multitude of workers of iniquity. {63:4} For they have
sharpened their tongues like a sword; they have formed their
bow into a bitter thing, {63:5} so that they may shoot arrows
from hiding at the immaculate. {63:6} They will suddenly
shoot arrows at him, and they will not be afraid. They are
resolute in their wicked talk. They have discussed hidden
snares. They have said, “Who will see them?” {63:7} They
have been searching carefully for iniquities. Their exhaustive
search has failed. Man will approach with a deep heart,
{63:8} and God will be exalted. The arrows of the little ones
have become their wounds, {63:9} and their tongues have
been weakened against them. All those who saw them have
been troubled; {63:10} and every man was afraid. And they
announced the works of God, and they understood his acts.
{63:11} The just will rejoice in the Lord, and they will hope
in him. And all the upright of heart will be praised.


[Gospel Canticle} “My soul magnifies
the Lord. {1:47} And my spirit leaps for joy in God my
Saviour. {1:48} For he has looked with favor on the humility
of his handmaid. For behold, from this time, all generations
shall call me blessed. {1:49} For he who is great has done
great things for me, and holy is his name. {1:50} And his
mercy is from generation to generations for those who fear
him. {1:51} He has accomplished powerful deeds with his
arm. He has scattered the arrogant in the intentions of their
heart. {1:52} He has deposed the powerful from their seat,
and he has exalted the humble. {1:53} He has filled the
hungry with good things, and the rich he has sent away
empty. {1:54} He has taken up his servant Israel, mindful of
his mercy, {1:55} just as he spoke to our fathers: to Abraham
and to his offspring forever.”


)Night Prayer

[Psalm 64] (Psalm 65) {64:1} Unto the end. A Psalm of
David. A Canticle of Jeremiah and Ezekiel to the people of
the captivity, when they began to go into exile. {64:2} O God,
a hymn adorns you in Zion, and a vow will be repaid to you
in Jerusalem. {64:3} Hear my prayer: all flesh will come to
you. {64:4} Words of iniquity have prevailed over us. And
you will pardon our impieties. {64:5} Blessed is he whom
you have chosen and taken up. He will dwell in your courts.
We will be filled with the good things of your house. Holy is
your temple: {64:6} wonderful in equity. Hear us, O God our
Savior, the hope of all the ends of the earth and of a sea far
away. {64:7} You prepare the mountains in your virtue,
wrapped with power. {64:8} You stir up the depths of the sea,
the noise of its waves. The nations will be troubled,
{64:9} and those who dwell at the limits will be afraid, before
your signs. You will make the passing of morning and
evening enjoyable. {64:10} You have visited the earth, and
you have saturated it. You have enriched it in so many ways.
The river of God has been filled with water. You have
prepared their food. For thus is its preparation.
{64:11} Drench its streams, multiply its fruits; it will spring
up and rejoice in its showers. {64:12} You will bless the
crown of the year with your kindness, and your fields will be
filled with abundance. {64:13} The beauty of the desert will
fatten, and the hills will be wrapped with exultation.
{64:14} The rams of the sheep have been clothed, and the
valleys will abound with grain. They will cry out; yes, they
will even utter a hymn.


[Gospel Canticle] {2:29} “Now you may dismiss your servant in peace, O Lord,
according to your word. {2:30} For my eyes have seen your
salvation, {2:31} which you have prepared before the face of
all peoples: {2:32} the light of revelation to the nations and
the glory of your people Israel.”


]Monday 2

)Office of Readings

[Psalm 65] (Psalm 66) {65:1} Unto the end. A Canticle
Psalm of the Resurrection. Shout joyfully to God, all the
earth. {65:2} Proclaim a psalm to his name. Give glory to his
praise. {65:3} Exclaim to God, “How terrible are your works,
O Lord!” According to the fullness of your virtue, your
enemies will speak lies about you. {65:4} Let all the earth
adore you and sing psalms to you. May it sing a psalm to
your name. {65:5} Draw near and see the works of God, who
is terrible in his counsels over the sons of men. {65:6} He
converts the sea into dry land. They will cross the river on
foot. There, we will rejoice in him. {65:7} He rules by his
virtue for eternity. His eyes gaze upon the nations. May those
who exasperate him, not be exalted in themselves.
{65:8} Bless our God, you Gentiles, and make the voice of
his praise be heard. {65:9} He has set my soul toward life,
and he has granted that my feet may not be shaken.
{65:10} For you, O God, have tested us. You have examined
us by fire, just as silver is examined. {65:11} You have led us
into a snare. You have placed tribulations on our back.
{65:12} You have set men over our heads. We have crossed
through fire and water. And you have led us out to
refreshment. {65:13} I will enter your house with holocausts.
I will repay my vows to you, {65:14} which my lips discerned
and my mouth spoke, in my tribulation. {65:15} I will offer
to you holocausts full of marrow, with the burnt offerings of
rams. I will offer to you bulls as well as goats. {65:16} Draw
near and listen, all you who fear God, and I will describe to
you how much he has done for my soul. {65:17} I cried out
to him with my mouth, and I extolled him under my breath.
{65:18} If I have seen iniquity in my heart, the Lord would
not heed me. {65:19} And yet, God has heeded me and he
has attended to the voice of my supplication. {65:20} Blessed
is God, who has not removed my prayer, nor his mercy, from
me.


[Psalm 66] (Psalm 67) {66:1} Unto the end. With hymns, a
Canticle Psalm of David. {66:2} May God have mercy on us
and bless us. May he shine his countenance upon us, and
may he have mercy on us. {66:3} So may we know your way
upon the earth, your salvation among all nations. {66:4} Let
the peoples confess to you, O God. Let all the peoples confess
to you. {66:5} May the nations rejoice and exult. For you
judge the peoples with equity, and you direct the nations on
earth. {66:6} Let the peoples confess to you, O God. Let all
the peoples confess to you. {66:7} The earth has provided her
fruit. May God, our God, bless us. {66:8} May God bless us,
and may all the ends of the earth fear him.


)Morning Prayer

[Psalm 67] (Psalm 68) {67:1} Unto the end. A Canticle
Psalm of David himself. {67:2} May God rise up, and may
his enemies be scattered, and may those who hate him flee
from before his face. {67:3} Just as smoke vanishes, so may
they vanish. Just as wax flows away before the face of fire, so
may sinners pass away before the face of God. {67:4} And so,
let the just feast, and let them exult in the sight of God and be
delighted in gladness. {67:5} Sing to God, sing a psalm to his
name. Make a path for him, who ascends over the west. The
Lord is his name. Exult in his sight; they will be stirred up
before his face, {67:6} the father of orphans and the judge of
widows. God is in his holy place. {67:7} It is God who
makes men dwell in a house under one custom. He leads out
those who are strongly bound, and similarly, those who
exasperate, who dwell in sepulchers. {67:8} O God, when
you departed in the sight of your people, when you passed
through the desert, {67:9} the earth was moved, for the
heavens rained down before the face of the God of Sinai,
before the face of the God of Israel. {67:10} You will set
aside for your inheritance, O God, a willing rain. And though
it was weak, truly, you have made it perfect. {67:11} Your
animals will dwell in it. O God, in your sweetness, you have
provided for the poor. {67:12} The Lord will give the word to
evangelizers, along with great virtue. {67:13} The King of
virtue is beloved among the beloved. And the beauty of the
house will divide spoils. {67:14} If you take your rest in the
midst of the clergy, you will be like a dove whose wings are
covered with fine silver and edged with pale gold.
{67:15} When heaven discerns kings to be over her, they will
be whitened with the snows of Zalmon. {67:16} The
mountain of God is a fat mountain, a dense mountain, a
thick mountain. {67:17} So then, why are you distrustful of
dense mountains? The mountain on which God is well
pleased to dwell, even there, the Lord will dwell until the end.
{67:18} The chariot of God is ten thousand fold: thousands
rejoice. The Lord is with them in Sinai, in the holy place.
{67:19} You have ascended on high; you have taken captivity
captive. You have accepted gifts among men. For even those
who do not believe dwell with the Lord God. {67:20} Blessed
is the Lord, day after day. The God of our salvation will
make our journey prosper for us. {67:21} Our God is the
God who will bring about our salvation, and our Lord is the
Lord who has brought an end to death. {67:22} So then, truly,
God will break the heads of his enemies, the hairy skull of
those who wander around in their offenses. {67:23} The Lord
said: I will turn them away from Bashan, I will turn them
into the depths of the sea, {67:24} so that your feet may be
soaked in the blood of your enemies, so that the tongue of
your dogs may be soaked with the same. {67:25} O God,
they have seen your arrival, the arrival of my God, of my
king who is in a holy place. {67:26} The leaders went ahead,
united with the singers of psalms, in the midst of girls playing
on timbrels. {67:27} In the churches, bless the Lord God
from the fountains of Israel. {67:28} In that place, Benjamin
is a youth in ecstasy of mind. The leaders of Judah are their
governors: the leaders of Zebulun, the leaders of Naphtali.
{67:29} Command by your virtue, O God. Confirm in this
place, O God, what you have wrought in us. {67:30} Before
your temple in Jerusalem, kings will offer gifts to you.
{67:31} Rebuke the wild beasts of the reeds, a congregation
of bulls with the cows of the people, for they seek to exclude
those who have been tested like silver. Scatter the nations that
are pleased by wars. {67:32} Ambassadors will come out of
Egypt. Ethiopia will offer in advance her hands to God.
{67:33} Sing to God, O kingdoms of the earth. Sing psalms
to the Lord. Sing psalms to God. {67:34} He ascends, up to
the heaven of the heavens, toward the east. Behold, he will
utter his voice, the voice of virtue. {67:35} Give glory to God
beyond Israel. His magnificence and his virtue is in the
clouds. {67:36} God is wonderful in his saints. The God of
Israel himself will give virtue and strength to his people.
Blessed is God.


[Psalm 68] (Psalm 69) {68:1} Unto the end. For those who
will be changed: of David. {68:2} Save me, O God, for the
waters have entered, even to my soul. {68:3} I have become
stuck in a deep quagmire, and there is no firm footing. I have
arrived at the height of the sea, and a tempest has
overwhelmed me. {68:4} I have endured hardships, while
crying out. My jaws have become hoarse; my eyes have failed.
Meanwhile, I hope in my God. {68:5} Those who hate me
without cause have been multiplied beyond the hairs of my
head. My enemies, who persecuted me unjustly, have been
strengthened. Then I was required to pay for what I did not
take. {68:6} O God, you know my foolishness, and my
offenses have not been hidden from you. {68:7} Let those
who wait for you, O Lord, the Lord of hosts, not be shamed
in me. Let those who seek you, O God of Israel, not be
confounded over me. {68:8} For because of you, I have
endured reproach; confusion has covered my face. {68:9} I
have become a stranger to my brothers and a sojourner to the
sons of my mother. {68:10} For zeal for your house has
consumed me, and the reproaches of those who reproached
you have fallen upon me. {68:11} And I covered my soul
with fasting, and it has become a reproach to me.
{68:12} And I put on a haircloth as my garment, and I
became a parable to them. {68:13} Those who sat at the gate
spoke against me, and those who drank wine made me their
song. {68:14} But as for me, truly, my prayer is to you, O
Lord. This time has pleased you well, O God. In the
multitude of your mercy, in the truth of your salvation, hear
me. {68:15} Rescue me from the quagmire, so that I may not
become trapped. Free me from those who hate me and from
deep waters. {68:16} Do not allow the tempest of water to
submerge me, nor the deep to absorb me. And do not allow
the well to close in on me. {68:17} Hear me, O Lord, for
your mercy is kind. Look upon me, according to the fullness
of your compassion. {68:18} And do not turn your face away
from your servant, for I am in trouble: heed me quickly.
{68:19} Attend to my soul, and free it. Rescue me, because of
my enemies. {68:20} You know my reproach, and my
confusion, and my reverence. {68:21} All those who trouble
me are in your sight; my heart has anticipated reproach and
misery. And I sought for one who might grieve together with
me, but there was no one, and for one who might console me,
and I found no one. {68:22} And they gave me gall for my
food. And in my thirst, they gave me vinegar to drink.
{68:23} Let their table be a snare before them, and a
retribution, and a scandal. {68:24} Let their eyes be darkened,
so that they may not see, and may their back always be
crooked. {68:25} Pour out your indignation upon them, and
may the fury of your anger take hold of them. {68:26} May
their dwelling place be deserted, and may there be no one
who dwells in their tabernacles. {68:27} For they persecuted
whomever you struck. And they have added to the grief of
my wounds. {68:28} Assign an iniquity upon their iniquity,
and may they not enter into your justice. {68:29} Delete
them from the Book of the Living, and let them not be
written down with the just. {68:30} I am poor and sorrowful,
but your salvation, O God, has taken me up. {68:31} I will
praise the name of God with a canticle, and I will magnify
him with praise. {68:32} And it will please God more than a
new calf producing horns and hoofs. {68:33} Let the poor see
and rejoice. Seek God, and your soul will live. {68:34} For
the Lord has heard the poor, and he has not despised his
prisoners. {68:35} Let the heavens and the earth praise him:
the sea, and everything that crawls in it. {68:36} For God
will save Zion, and the cities of Judah will be built up. And
they will dwell there, and they will acquire it by inheritance.
{68:37} And the offspring of his servants will possess it; and
those who love his name will dwell in it.


[Gospel Canticle] {1:68} “Blessed is the Lord God of Israel. For he has
visited and has wrought the redemption of his people.
{1:69} And he has raised up a horn of salvation for us, in the
house of David his servant, {1:70} just as he spoke by the
mouth of his holy Prophets, who are from ages past:
{1:71} salvation from our enemies, and from the hand of all
those who hate us, {1:72} to accomplish mercy with our
fathers, and to call to mind his holy testament, {1:73} the
oath, which he swore to Abraham, our father, that he would
grant to us, {1:74} so that, having been freed from the hand
of our enemies, we may serve him without fear, {1:75} in
holiness and in justice before him, throughout all our days.
{1:76} And you, child, shall be called the prophet of the Most
High. For you will go before the face of the Lord: to prepare
his ways, {1:77} to give knowledge of salvation to his people
for the remission of their sins, {1:78} through the heart of the
mercy of our God, by which, descending from on high, he
has visited us, {1:79} to illuminate those who sit in darkness
and in the shadow of death, and to direct our feet in the way
of peace.”


)Midday Prayer

[Psalm 69] (Psalm 70) {69:1} Unto the end. A Psalm of
David, in remembrance that the Lord had saved him.
{69:2} O God, reach out to help me. O Lord, hasten to assist
me. {69:3} May those who seek my soul be confounded and
awed. {69:4} May those who wish evils upon me be turned
back and blush with shame. May they be turned away
immediately, blushing with shame, who say to me: “Well,
well.” {69:5} Let all who seek you exult and rejoice in you,
and let those who love your salvation forever say: “The Lord
be magnified.” {69:6} I am truly destitute and poor. O God,
assist me. You are my helper and my deliverer. O Lord, do
not delay.


)Evening Prayer

[Psalm 70] (Psalm 71) {70:1} A Psalm of David. Of the sons
of Jonadab and the former captives. In you, O Lord, I have
hoped; do not let me be brought to ruin forever. {70:2} Free
me by your justice, and rescue me. Incline your ear to me,
and save me. {70:3} Be a God of protection and a place of
strength for me, so that you may accomplish my salvation.
For you are my firmament and my refuge. {70:4} Rescue me,
O my God, from the hand of the sinner, and from the hand of
the unjust and those who act against the law. {70:5} For you,
O Lord, are my patience: my hope from my youth, O Lord.
{70:6} In you, I have been confirmed from conception. From
my mother’s womb, you are my protector. In you, I will sing
forever. {70:7} I have become to many as if I were a portent,
but you are a strong helper. {70:8} Let my mouth be filled
with praise, so that I may sing your glory, your greatness all
day long. {70:9} Do not cast me off in the time of old age.
Do not abandon me when my strength will fail. {70:10} For
my enemies have spoken against me. And those who
watched for my soul have taken counsel as one,
{70:11} saying: “God has abandoned him. Pursue and
overtake him. For there is no one to rescue him.” {70:12} O
God, do not be far from me. O my God, provide for my
assistance. {70:13} May they be confounded, and may they
fail, who drag down my soul. Let them be covered with
confusion and shame, who seek evils for me. {70:14} But I
will always have hope. And I will add more to all your praise.
{70:15} My mouth will announce your justice, your salvation
all day long. For I have not known letters. {70:16} I will
enter into the powers of the Lord. I will be mindful of your
justice alone, O Lord. {70:17} You have taught me from my
youth, O God. And so I will declare your wonders
continuously, {70:18} even in old age and with grey hairs.
Do not abandon me, O God, while I announce your arm to
every future generation: your power {70:19} and your justice,
O God, even to the highest great things that you have done.
O God, who is like you? {70:20} How great is the tribulation
that you have revealed to me: very great and evil. And so,
turning back, you have brought me to life, and you have led
me back again from the abyss of the earth. {70:21} You have
multiplied your magnificence. And so, turning back to me,
you have consoled me. {70:22} Therefore, I will confess your
truth to you, with the instruments of the Psalter. O God, I
will sing psalms to you with stringed instruments, O Holy
One of Israel. {70:23} My lips will exult, when I sing to you,
and also my soul, which you have redeemed. {70:24} And
even my tongue will meditate on your justice all day long,
when those who seek evils for me have been confounded and
set in awe.


[Psalm 71] (Psalm 72) {71:1} A Psalm according to Solomon.
{71:2} Give your judgment, O God, to the king, and your
justice to the king’s son, to judge your people with justice and
your poor with judgment. {71:3} Let the mountains take up
peace for the people, and the hills, justice. {71:4} He will
judge the poor of the people, and he will bring salvation to
the sons of the poor. And he will humble the false accuser.
{71:5} And he will remain, with the sun and before the moon,
from generation to generation. {71:6} He will descend like
rain upon fleece, and like showers showering upon the earth.
{71:7} In his days, justice will rise like the sun, with
abundance of peace, until the moon is taken away.
{71:8} And he will rule from sea to sea and from the river to
the limits of the whole world. {71:9} In his sight, the
Ethiopians will fall prostrate, and his enemies will lick the
ground. {71:10} The kings of Tarshish and the islands will
offer gifts. The kings of Arabia and of Seba will bring gifts.
{71:11} And all the kings of the earth shall adore him. All
nations will serve him. {71:12} For he will free the poor from
the powerful, and the poor one who has no helper.
{71:13} He will spare the poor and the indigent, and he will
bring salvation to the souls of the poor. {71:14} He will
redeem their souls from usuries and from iniquity, and their
names shall be honorable in his sight. {71:15} And he will
live, and to him will be given from the gold of Arabia, and by
him they will always adore. They will bless him all day long.
{71:16} And there will be a firmament on earth, at the
summits of mountains: its fruits will be extolled above
Lebanon, and those of the city will flourish like the grass of
the earth. {71:17} May his name be blessed forever; may his
name remain before the sun. And all the tribes of the earth
will be blessed in him. All nations will magnify him.
{71:18} Blessed is the Lord, God of Israel, who alone does
wondrous things. {71:19} And blessed is the name of his
majesty in eternity. And all the earth will be filled with his
majesty. Amen. Amen. {71:20} The praises of David, the son
of Jesse, have reached an end.


[Gospel Canticle} “My soul magnifies
the Lord. {1:47} And my spirit leaps for joy in God my
Saviour. {1:48} For he has looked with favor on the humility
of his handmaid. For behold, from this time, all generations
shall call me blessed. {1:49} For he who is great has done
great things for me, and holy is his name. {1:50} And his
mercy is from generation to generations for those who fear
him. {1:51} He has accomplished powerful deeds with his
arm. He has scattered the arrogant in the intentions of their
heart. {1:52} He has deposed the powerful from their seat,
and he has exalted the humble. {1:53} He has filled the
hungry with good things, and the rich he has sent away
empty. {1:54} He has taken up his servant Israel, mindful of
his mercy, {1:55} just as he spoke to our fathers: to Abraham
and to his offspring forever.”


)Night Prayer

[Psalm 72] (Psalm 73) {72:1} A Psalm of Asaph. How good
is God to Israel, to those who are upright in heart. {72:2} But
my feet were nearly moved; my steps had nearly slipped.
{72:3} For I was zealous over the iniquitous, seeing the
peacefulness of sinners. {72:4} For they have no respect for
their death, nor do they have support in their wounds.
{72:5} They are not with the hardships of men, nor will they
be scourged with men. {72:6} Therefore, arrogance has held
on to them. They have been covered with their iniquity and
impiety. {72:7} Their iniquity has proceeded, as if from fat.
They have parted from the affection of the heart. {72:8} They
have thought and spoken wickedness. They have spoken
iniquity in high places. {72:9} They have set their mouth
against heaven, and their tongue has traversed the earth.
{72:10} Therefore, my people will be converted here, and
fullness of days will be found in them. {72:11} And they said,
“How would God know?” and, “Isn’t there knowledge in
high places?” {72:12} Behold, these are sinners, and,
abounding in this age, they have obtained riches.
{72:13} And I said: So then, it is without purpose that I have
justified my heart and washed my hands among the innocent.
{72:14} And I have been scourged all day long, and I have
received my chastisement in the mornings. {72:15} If I were
to say that I would explain this: Behold, I would condemn
this nation of your sons. {72:16} I considered, so that I might
know this. It is a hardship before me, {72:17} until I may
enter into the Sanctuary of God, and understand it to its last
part. {72:18} So, because of deceitfulness, truly, you have
placed it before them. While they were being lifted up, you
were casting them down. {72:19} How have they been
brought to desolation? They have suddenly failed. They have
perished because of their iniquity. {72:20} As a dream is to
those who awaken, O Lord, so will you reduce their image to
nothing in your city. {72:21} For my heart has been inflamed,
and my temperament has been changed. {72:22} And so, I
have been reduced to nothing, and I did not know it.
{72:23} I have become like a beast of burden to you, and I
am always with you. {72:24} You have held my right hand.
And in your will, you have conducted me, and with your
glory, you have taken me up. {72:25} For what is there for
me in heaven? And what do I wish for on earth before you?
{72:26} My body has failed, and my heart: O God of my
heart, and God my portion, into eternity. {72:27} For behold,
those who put themselves far from you will perish. You have
perished all those who fornicate away from you. {72:28} But
it is good for me to adhere to God, to put my hope in the
Lord God, so that I may announce all your prophecies, at the
gates of the daughter of Zion.


[Gospel Canticle] {2:29} “Now you may dismiss your servant in peace, O Lord,
according to your word. {2:30} For my eyes have seen your
salvation, {2:31} which you have prepared before the face of
all peoples: {2:32} the light of revelation to the nations and
the glory of your people Israel.”


]Tuesday 2

)Office of Readings

[Psalm 73] (Psalm 74) {73:1} The understanding of Asaph.
O God, why have you rejected us to the end. Why has your
fury become enraged over the sheep of your pasture?
{73:2} Be mindful of your congregation, which you have
possessed from the beginning. You redeemed the scepter of
your inheritance, mount Zion, in which you have dwelt.
{73:3} Lift up your hands against their arrogance in the end.
How great the malice of the enemy has been in the sanctuary!
{73:4} And those who hate you have been glorified, in the
midst of your solemnity. They have set up their own signs as
a proof, {73:5} as if it had been issued from on high; yet they
did not understand. As in a forest of chopped wood,
{73:6} they have cut down the entrances themselves. With
axe and hatchet, they have brought it down. {73:7} They
have set fire to your Sanctuary. They have polluted the
tabernacle of your name on earth. {73:8} They have said in
their heart, the whole group of them together: “Let us cause
all the feast days of God to cease from the land. {73:9} We
have not seen our proof; there is now no prophet. And he will
no longer know us.” {73:10} How long, O God, will the
enemy place blame? Is the adversary to provoke your name
until the end? {73:11} Why do you turn your hand away,
even your right hand, from the midst of your sinews, until the
end? {73:12} But God is our king before all ages. He has
wrought salvation in the midst of the earth. {73:13} In your
virtue, you confirmed the sea. You crushed the heads of the
serpents in the waters. {73:14} You have broken the heads of
the serpent. You have given him as food for the people of the
Ethiopians. {73:15} You have disrupted the fountains and
the torrents. You have dried up the rivers of Ethan.
{73:16} Yours is the day, and yours is the night. You have
made the morning light and the sun. {73:17} You have made
all the limits of the earth. The summer and the spring were
formed by you. {73:18} Be mindful of this: the enemy placed
blame against the Lord, and a foolish people has incited
against your name. {73:19} Do not hand over to beasts the
souls that confess to you; and do not forget the souls of your
poor until the end. {73:20} Consider your covenant. For
those who have been darkened upon the earth have been
filled by the iniquity of the houses. {73:21} Do not allow the
humble to be turned away in confusion. The poor and the
needy will praise your name. {73:22} Rise up, O God, judge
your own case. Call to mind the accusations against you,
which are made by the foolish all day long. {73:23} Do not
forget the voices of your adversaries. The arrogance of those
who hate you rises up continually.


[Psalm 74] (Psalm 75) {74:1} Unto the end. May you not be
corrupted. A Canticle Psalm of Asaph. {74:2} We will
confess to you, O God. We will confess, and we will call
upon your name. We will describe your wonders.
{74:3} While I have time, I will judge justices. {74:4} The
earth has been dissolved, with all who dwell in it. I have
confirmed its pillars. {74:5} I said to the iniquitous: “Do not
act unjustly,” and to the offenders: “Do not exalt the horn.”
{74:6} Do not exalt your horn on high. Do not speak iniquity
against God. {74:7} For it is neither from the east, nor from
the west, nor before the desert mountains. {74:8} For God is
judge. This one he humbles and that one he exalts.
{74:9} For, in the hand of the Lord, there is a cup of
undiluted wine, full of consternation. And he has tipped it
from here to there. So, truly, its dregs have not been emptied.
All the sinners of the earth will drink. {74:10} But I will
announce it in every age. I will sing to the God of Jacob.
{74:11} And I will break all the horns of sinners. And the
horns of the just will be exalted.


)Morning Prayer

[Psalm 75] (Psalm 76) {75:1} Unto the end. With Praises. A
Psalm of Asaph. A Canticle to the Assyrians. {75:2} In Judea,
God is known. In Israel, his name is great. {75:3} And his
place has been formed with peace. And his dwelling place is
in Zion. {75:4} In that place, he has broken the powers of the
bows, the shield, the sword, and the battle. {75:5} You
illuminate wondrously from the mountains of eternity.
{75:6} All the foolish of heart have been disturbed. They
have slept their sleep, and all the men of riches have found
nothing in their hands. {75:7} At your rebuke, O God of
Jacob, those who were mounted on horseback have fallen
asleep. {75:8} You are terrible, and so, who can withstand
you? From thence is your wrath. {75:9} You have caused
judgment to be heard from heaven. The earth trembled and
was quieted, {75:10} when God rose up in judgment in order
to bring salvation to all the meek of the earth. {75:11} For the
thinking of man will confess to you, and the legacy of his
thinking will keep a feast day to you. {75:12} Make vows and
pay them to the Lord, your God. All you who surround him
bring gifts: to him who is terrible, {75:13} even to him who
takes away the spirit of leaders, to him who is terrible with
the kings of the earth.


[Psalm 76] (Psalm 77) {76:1} Unto the end. For Jeduthun. A
Psalm of Asaph. {76:2} I cried out to the Lord with my voice,
to God with my voice, and he attended to me. {76:3} In the
days of my tribulation, I sought God, with my hands
opposite him in the night, and I was not deceived. My soul
refused to be consoled. {76:4} I was mindful of God, and I
was delighted, and I was distressed, and my spirit fell away.
{76:5} My eyes anticipated the vigils. I was disturbed, and I
did not speak. {76:6} I considered the days of antiquity, and I
held the years of eternity in my mind. {76:7} And I meditated
in the night with my heart, and I was distressed, and I
examined my spirit. {76:8} So then, will God reject for
eternity? Will he not continue to allow himself to show favor?
{76:9} Or, will he cut off his mercy in the end, from
generation to generation? {76:10} And would God ever
forget to be merciful? Or, would he, in his wrath, restrict his
mercies? {76:11} And I said, “Now I have begun. This
change is from the right hand of the Most High.” {76:12} I
was mindful of the works of the Lord. For I will be mindful
from the beginning of your wonders, {76:13} and I will
meditate on all your works. And I will take part in your
intentions. {76:14} Your way, O God, is in what is holy.
Which God is great like our God? {76:15} You are the God
who performs miracles. You have made your virtue known
among the peoples. {76:16} With your arm, you have
redeemed your people, the sons of Jacob and of Joseph.
{76:17} The waters saw you, O God, the waters saw you,
and they were afraid, and the depths were stirred up.
{76:18} Great was the sound of the waters. The clouds
uttered a voice. For your arrows also pass by. {76:19} The
voice of your thunder is like a wheel. Your flashes have
illuminated the whole world. The earth has quaked and
trembled. {76:20} Your way is through the sea, and your
paths are through many waters. And your traces will not be
known. {76:21} You have conducted your people like sheep,
by the hand of Moses and Aaron.


[Gospel Canticle] {1:68} “Blessed is the Lord God of Israel. For he has
visited and has wrought the redemption of his people.
{1:69} And he has raised up a horn of salvation for us, in the
house of David his servant, {1:70} just as he spoke by the
mouth of his holy Prophets, who are from ages past:
{1:71} salvation from our enemies, and from the hand of all
those who hate us, {1:72} to accomplish mercy with our
fathers, and to call to mind his holy testament, {1:73} the
oath, which he swore to Abraham, our father, that he would
grant to us, {1:74} so that, having been freed from the hand
of our enemies, we may serve him without fear, {1:75} in
holiness and in justice before him, throughout all our days.
{1:76} And you, child, shall be called the prophet of the Most
High. For you will go before the face of the Lord: to prepare
his ways, {1:77} to give knowledge of salvation to his people
for the remission of their sins, {1:78} through the heart of the
mercy of our God, by which, descending from on high, he
has visited us, {1:79} to illuminate those who sit in darkness
and in the shadow of death, and to direct our feet in the way
of peace.”


)Midday Prayer

[Psalm 77] (Psalm 78) {77:1} The understanding of Asaph.
O my people, attend to my law. Incline your ears to the
words of my mouth. {77:2} I will open my mouth in parables.
I will speak about concepts that are from the beginning.
{77:3} We have heard and known such great things, as our
fathers have described to us. {77:4} These things have not
been hidden from their sons in any generation: declaring the
praises of the Lord, and his virtues, and the wonders that he
has done. {77:5} And he has received testimony with Jacob,
and he has set a law within Israel. Such great things, he has
commanded our fathers, so as to make these things known to
their sons, {77:6} so that another generation might know
them, and so that the sons, who will be born and who will
grow up, shall describe them to their sons. {77:7} So then,
may they put their hope in God, and may they not forget the
works of God, and may they seek his commandments.
{77:8} May they not become like their fathers, a perverse and
exasperating generation: a generation that does not straighten
their heart and whose spirit is not trustworthy with God.
{77:9} The sons of Ephraim, who bend and shoot the bow,
have been turned back in the day of battle. {77:10} They have
not kept the covenant of God. And they were not willing to
walk in his law. {77:11} And they have been forgetful of his
benefits, and of his miracle, which he revealed to them.
{77:12} He performed miracles in the sight of their fathers, in
the land of Egypt, in the field of Tanis. {77:13} He broke the
sea and he led them through. And he stationed the waters, as
if in a vessel. {77:14} And he led them with a cloud by day,
and with illumination by fire throughout the night.
{77:15} He broke through the rock in the wasteland, and he
gave them to drink, as if from the great abyss. {77:16} He
brought forth water from the rock, and he conducted the
waters, as if they were rivers. {77:17} And yet, they
continued to sin against him. In a waterless place, they
provoked the Most High with resentment. {77:18} And they
tempted God in their hearts, by asking for food according to
their desires. {77:19} And they spoke badly about God. They
said, “Would God be able to prepare a table in the desert?
{77:20} He struck the rock, and so waters flowed and the
torrents flooded, but would even he be able to provide bread,
or provide a table, for his people?” {77:21} Therefore, the
Lord heard, and he was dismayed, and a fire was kindled
within Jacob, and an anger ascended into Israel. {77:22} For
they neither put their trust in God, nor did they hope in his
salvation. {77:23} And he commanded the clouds from
above, and he opened the doors of heaven. {77:24} And he
rained down manna upon them to eat, and he gave them the
bread of heaven. {77:25} Man ate the bread of Angels. He
sent them provisions in abundance. {77:26} He transferred
the south wind from heaven, and, in his virtue, he brought in
the Southwest wind. {77:27} And he rained down flesh upon
them, as if it were dust, and feathered birds, as if they were
the sand of the sea. {77:28} And they fell down in the midst
of their camp, encircling their tabernacles. {77:29} And they
ate until they were greatly satisfied, and he brought to them
according to their desires. {77:30} They were not cheated out
of what they wanted. Their food was still in their mouth,
{77:31} and then the wrath of God came upon them. And he
slew the fat ones among them, and he impeded the elect of
Israel. {77:32} In all these things, they continued to sin, and
they were not trustworthy with his miracles. {77:33} And
their days faded away into vanity, and their years with haste.
{77:34} When he slew them, then they sought him. And they
returned, and they drew near to him in the early morning.
{77:35} And they were mindful that God is their helper and
that the Most High God is their redeemer. {77:36} And they
chose him with their mouth, and then they lied to him with
their tongue. {77:37} For their heart was not upright with
him, nor have they been living faithfully in his covenant.
{77:38} Yet he is merciful, and he will pardon their sins. And
he will not destroy them. And he has abundantly turned aside
his own wrath. And he did not enflame his wrath entirely.
{77:39} And he remembered that they are flesh: with a spirit
that goes forth and does not return. {77:40} How often did
they provoke him in the desert and stir him to wrath in a
waterless place? {77:41} And they turned back and tempted
God, and they exasperated the Holy One of Israel.
{77:42} They did not remember his hand, in the day that he
redeemed them from the hand of the one troubling them.
{77:43} Thus, he positioned his signs in Egypt and his
wonders in the field of Tanis. {77:44} And he turned their
rivers into blood, along with their rain showers, so that they
could not drink. {77:45} He sent among them the common
fly, and it devoured them, and the frog, and it scattered them.
{77:46} And he gave up their fruits to mold and their labors
to the locust. {77:47} And he slew their vineyards with hail
and their mulberry trees with severe frost. {77:48} And he
delivered their cattle to the hail and their possessions to fire.
{77:49} And he sent the wrath of his indignation among
them: indignation and wrath and tribulation, sent forth by
evil angels. {77:50} He made way for the path of his anger.
He did not spare their souls from death. And he enclosed
their beasts of burden in death. {77:51} And he struck all the
first-born in the land of Egypt: the first-fruits of all their labor
in the tabernacles of Ham. {77:52} And he took away his
own people like sheep, and he led them through the
wilderness like a flock. {77:53} And he led them out in hope,
and they did not fear. And the sea covered their enemies.
{77:54 And he led them to the mountain of his
sanctification: the mountain that his right hand had acquired.
And he cast out the Gentiles before their face. And he
divided their land by lot to them, with a line of distribution.
{77:55} And he caused the tribes of Israel to dwell in their
tabernacles. {77:56} Yet they tempted and aggravated God
Most High, and they did not keep his testaments.
{77:57} And they turned themselves aside, and they did not
serve the covenant. In the same manner as their fathers, they
were turned backwards, like a crooked bow. {77:58} They
impelled him to anger on their hills, and they provoked him
to rivalry with their graven images. {77:59} God listened,
and he spurned them, and he reduced Israel greatly, almost to
nothing. {77:60} And he rejected the tabernacle of Shiloh, his
tabernacle where he had dwelt among men. {77:61} And he
delivered their virtue into captivity, and their beauty into the
hands of the enemy. {77:62} And he enclosed his people with
the sword, and he spurned his inheritance. {77:63} Fire
consumed their young men, and their virgins were not
lamented. {77:64} Their priests fell by the sword, and their
widows did not weep. {77:65} And the Lord was awaked, as
if out of sleep, and like a powerful man impaired by wine.
{77:66} And he struck his enemies on the back. He gave
them over to everlasting disgrace. {77:67} And he rejected
the tabernacle of Joseph, and he did not choose the tribe of
Ephraim. {77:68} But he chose the tribe of Judah: mount
Zion, which he loved. {77:69} And he built up his sanctuary,
like a single-horned beast, in the land that he founded for all
ages. {77:70} And he chose his servant David, and he took
him from the flocks of the sheep: he received him from
following the ewes with their young, {77:71} in order to
pasture Jacob his servant and Israel his inheritance.
{77:72} And he fed them with the innocence of his heart.
And he led them with the understanding of his hands.


)Evening Prayer

[Psalm 78] (Psalm 79) {78:1} A Psalm of Asaph. O God, the
Gentiles have entered into your inheritance; they have
polluted your holy temple. They have set Jerusalem as a
place to tend fruit trees. {78:2} They have placed the dead
bodies of your servants as food for the birds of the sky, the
flesh of your saints for the beasts of the earth. {78:3} They
have poured out their blood like water all around Jerusalem,
and there was no one who would bury them. {78:4} We have
become a disgrace to our neighbors, an object of ridicule and
mockery to those who are around us. {78:5} How long, O
Lord? Will you be angry until the end? Will your zeal be
kindled like a fire? {78:6} Pour out your wrath among the
Gentiles, who have not known you, and upon the kingdoms
that have not invoked your name. {78:7} For they have
devoured Jacob, and they have desolated his place.
{78:8} Do not remember our iniquities of the past. May your
mercies quickly intercept us, for we have become exceedingly
poor. {78:9} Help us, O God, our Savior. And free us, Lord,
for the glory of your name. And forgive us our sins for the
sake of your name. {78:10} Let them not say among the
Gentiles, “Where is their God?” And may your name
become known among the nations before our eyes. For the
retribution of your servants’ blood, which has been poured
out: {78:11} may the groans of the shackled enter before you.
According to the greatness of your arm, take possession of
the sons of those who have been killed. {78:12} And repay
our neighbors sevenfold within their sinews. It is the reproach
of the same ones who brought reproach against you, O Lord.
{78:13} But we are your people and the sheep of your pasture:
we will give thanks to you in all ages. From generation to
generation, we will announce your praise.


[Psalm 79] (Psalm 80) {79:1} Unto the end. For those who
will be changed. The testimony of Asaph. A Psalm.
{79:2} The One who reigns over Israel: Be attentive. For you
lead Joseph like a sheep. The One who sits upon the
cherubim: Shine forth {79:3} in the presence of Ephraim,
Benjamin, and Manasseh. Awaken your power and draw
near, so as to accomplish our salvation. {79:4} Convert us, O
God. And reveal your face, and we will be saved. {79:5} O
Lord, God of hosts, how long will you be angry over the
prayer of your servant? {79:6} How long will you feed us the
bread of tears, and give us to drink a full measure of tears?
{79:7} You have set us as a contradiction to our neighbors.
And our enemies have ridiculed us. {79:8} O God of hosts,
convert us. And reveal your face, and we will be saved.
{79:9} You have transferred a vineyard from Egypt. You
have cast out the Gentiles, and planted it. {79:10} You were
the leader of the journey in its sight. You planted its roots,
and it filled the earth. {79:11} Its shadow covered the hills,
and its branches covered the cedars of God. {79:12} It
extended its new branches even to the sea, and its new
seedlings even to the river. {79:13} So then, why have you
destroyed its walls, so that all those who pass by the way
gather its grapes? {79:14} The wild boar of the forest has
trampled it, and a single wild beast has laid waste to it.
{79:15} Turn back, O God of hosts. Look down from heaven,
and see, and visit this vineyard; {79:16} and complete what
your right hand has planted, and look upon the son of man,
whom you have confirmed for yourself. {79:17} Whatever
has been set on fire and dug under will perish at the rebuke of
your countenance. {79:18} Let your hand be over the man on
your right, and over the son of man, whom you have
confirmed for yourself. {79:19} For we do not depart from
you, and you will revive us. And we will invoke your name.
{79:20} O Lord, God of hosts, convert us. And reveal your
face, and we will be saved.


[Gospel Canticle} “My soul magnifies
the Lord. {1:47} And my spirit leaps for joy in God my
Saviour. {1:48} For he has looked with favor on the humility
of his handmaid. For behold, from this time, all generations
shall call me blessed. {1:49} For he who is great has done
great things for me, and holy is his name. {1:50} And his
mercy is from generation to generations for those who fear
him. {1:51} He has accomplished powerful deeds with his
arm. He has scattered the arrogant in the intentions of their
heart. {1:52} He has deposed the powerful from their seat,
and he has exalted the humble. {1:53} He has filled the
hungry with good things, and the rich he has sent away
empty. {1:54} He has taken up his servant Israel, mindful of
his mercy, {1:55} just as he spoke to our fathers: to Abraham
and to his offspring forever.”


)Night Prayer

[Psalm 80] (Psalm 81) {80:1} Unto the end. For the wine and
oil presses. A Psalm of Asaph himself. {80:2} Exult before
God our helper. Sing joyfully to the God of Jacob.
{80:3} Take up a psalm, and bring forth the timbrel: a
pleasing Psalter with stringed instruments. {80:4} Sound the
trumpet at the new moon, on the noteworthy day of your
solemnity, {80:5} for it is a precept in Israel and a judgment
for the God of Jacob. {80:6} He set it as a testimony with
Joseph, when he went out of the land of Egypt. He heard a
tongue that he did not know. {80:7} He turned the burdens
away from his back. His hands had been a slave to baskets.
{80:8} You called upon me in tribulation, and I freed you. I
heard you within the hidden tempest. I tested you with
waters of contradiction. {80:9} My people, listen and I will
call you to testify. If, O Israel, you will pay heed to me,
{80:10} then there will be no new god among you, nor will
you adore a foreign god. {80:11} For I am the Lord your
God, who led you out of the land of Egypt. Widen your
mouth, and I will fill it. {80:12} But my people did not hear
my voice, and Israel was not attentive to me. {80:13} And so,
I sent them away, according to the desires of their heart.
They will go forth according to their own inventions.
{80:14} If my people had heard me, if Israel had walked in
my ways, {80:15} I would have humbled their enemies, as if
it were nothing, and I would have sent my hand upon those
who troubled them. {80:16} The enemies of the Lord have
lied to him, and their time will come, in every age.
{80:17} And he fed them from the fat of the grain, and he
saturated them with honey from the rock.


[Gospel Canticle] {2:29} “Now you may dismiss your servant in peace, O Lord,
according to your word. {2:30} For my eyes have seen your
salvation, {2:31} which you have prepared before the face of
all peoples: {2:32} the light of revelation to the nations and
the glory of your people Israel.”


]Wednesday 2

)Office of Readings

[Psalm 81] (Psalm 82) {81:1} A Psalm of Asaph. God has
stood in the synagogue of gods, but, in their midst, he decides
between gods. {81:2} How long will you judge unjustly and
favor the faces of sinners? {81:3} Judge for the indigent and
the orphan. Do justice to the humble and the poor.
{81:4} Rescue the poor, and free the needy from the hand of
the sinner. {81:5} They did not know and did not understand.
They wander in darkness. All the foundations of the earth
will be moved. {81:6} I said: You are gods, and all of you are
sons of the Most High. {81:7} But you will die like men, and
you will fall just like one of the princes. {81:8} Rise up, O
God. Judge the earth. For you will inherit it with all the
nations.


[Psalm 82] (Psalm 83) {82:1} A Canticle Psalm of Asaph.
{82:2} O God, who will ever be like you? Do not be silent,
and do not be unmoved, O God. {82:3} For behold, your
enemies have sounded off, and those who hate you have
carried out a head. {82:4} They have acted with malice in
counsel over your people, and they have plotted against your
holy ones. {82:5} They have said, “Come, let us scatter them
from the nations and not allow the name of Israel to be
remembered any longer.” {82:6} For they plotted
unanimously. Joined together against you, they ordained a
covenant: {82:7} the tabernacle of Edomites and Ishmaelites,
and Moab and the Hagarites, {82:8} and Gebal, and Ammon,
and Amalek, the foreigners among the inhabitants of Tyre.
{82:9} For even Assur comes with them. They have become
the helpers of the sons of Lot. {82:10} Do to them as you did
to Midian and Sisera, just as to Jabin at the torrent of Kishon.
{82:11} They perished at Endor, and they became like the
dung of the earth. {82:12} Set their leaders to be like Oreb
and Zeeb, and Zebah and Zalmunna: all their leaders
{82:13} who said, “Let us possess the Sanctuary of God for
an inheritance.” {82:14} My God, set them like a wheel, and
like stubble before the face of the wind. {82:15} Set them like
a fire burning up the forest, and like a flame burning up the
mountains. {82:16} So will you pursue them in your tempest,
and disturb them in your wrath. {82:17} Fill their faces with
shame, and they will seek your name, O Lord. {82:18} Let
them be ashamed and troubled, from age to age, and let them
be confounded and perish. {82:19} And let them know that
the Lord is your name. You alone are the Most High in all
the earth.


)Morning Prayer

[Psalm 83] (Psalm 84) {83:1} Unto the end. For the wine and
oil presses. A Psalm to the sons of Korah. {83:2} How
beloved are your tabernacles, O Lord of hosts! {83:3} My
soul longs and faints for the courts of the Lord. My heart and
my flesh have exulted in the living God. {83:4} For even the
sparrow has found a home for himself, and the turtle-dove a
nest for herself, where she may lay her young: your altars, O
Lord of hosts, my king and my God. {83:5} Blessed are those
who dwell in your house, O Lord. They will praise you from
age to age. {83:6} Blessed is the man whose help is from you.
In his heart, he is disposed to ascend {83:7} from the valley
of tears, from the place which he has determined. {83:8} For
even the lawgiver will provide a blessing; they will go from
virtue to virtue. The God of gods will be seen in Zion.
{83:9} O Lord, God of hosts, hear my prayer. Pay attention,
O God of Jacob. {83:10} O God, gaze upon our protector,
and look upon the face of your Christ. {83:11} For one day in
your courts is better than thousands elsewhere. I have chosen
to be lowly in the house of my God, rather than to dwell in
the tabernacles of sinners. {83:12} For God loves mercy and
truth. The Lord will give grace and glory. {83:13} He will not
withhold good things from those who walk in innocence. O
Lord of hosts, blessed is the man who hopes in you.


[Psalm 84] (Psalm 85) {84:1} Unto the end. A Psalm to the
sons of Korah. {84:2} O Lord, you have blessed your land.
You have turned aside the captivity of Jacob. {84:3} You
have released the iniquity of your people. You have covered
all their sins. {84:4} You have mitigated all your wrath. You
have turned aside from the wrath of your indignation.
{84:5} Convert us, O God, our Savior, and turn your anger
away from us. {84:6} Will you be angry with us forever? And
will you extend your wrath from generation to generation?
{84:7} O God, you will turn back and revive us. And your
people will rejoice in you. {84:8} O Lord, reveal to us your
mercy, and grant to us your salvation. {84:9} I will listen to
what the Lord God may be saying to me. For he will speak
peace to his people, and to his saints, and to those who are
being converted to the heart. {84:10} So then, truly his
salvation is near to those who fear him, so that glory may
inhabit our land. {84:11} Mercy and truth have met each
other. Justice and peace have kissed. {84:12} Truth has risen
from the earth, and justice has gazed down from heaven.
{84:13} For so will the Lord give goodness, and our earth
will give her fruit. {84:14} Justice will walk before him, and
he will set his steps upon the way.


[Gospel Canticle] {1:68} “Blessed is the Lord God of Israel. For he has
visited and has wrought the redemption of his people.
{1:69} And he has raised up a horn of salvation for us, in the
house of David his servant, {1:70} just as he spoke by the
mouth of his holy Prophets, who are from ages past:
{1:71} salvation from our enemies, and from the hand of all
those who hate us, {1:72} to accomplish mercy with our
fathers, and to call to mind his holy testament, {1:73} the
oath, which he swore to Abraham, our father, that he would
grant to us, {1:74} so that, having been freed from the hand
of our enemies, we may serve him without fear, {1:75} in
holiness and in justice before him, throughout all our days.
{1:76} And you, child, shall be called the prophet of the Most
High. For you will go before the face of the Lord: to prepare
his ways, {1:77} to give knowledge of salvation to his people
for the remission of their sins, {1:78} through the heart of the
mercy of our God, by which, descending from on high, he
has visited us, {1:79} to illuminate those who sit in darkness
and in the shadow of death, and to direct our feet in the way
of peace.”


)Midday Prayer

[Psalm 85] (Psalm 86) {85:1} A Prayer of David himself.
Incline your ear, O Lord, and hear me. For I am needy and
poor. {85:2} Preserve my soul, for I am holy. My God, bring
salvation to your servant who hopes in you. {85:3} O Lord,
be merciful to me, for I have cried out to you all day long.
{85:4} Give joy to the soul of your servant, for I have lifted
up my soul to you, Lord. {85:5} For you are sweet and mild,
Lord, and plentiful in mercy to all who call upon you.
{85:6} Pay attention, Lord, to my prayer, and attend to the
voice of my supplication. {85:7} In the day of my tribulation,
I cried out to you, because you heeded me. {85:8} There is
no one like you among the gods, O Lord, and there is no one
like you in your works. {85:9} All the nations, which you
have made, will draw near and adore in your presence, O
Lord. And they will glorify your name. {85:10} For you are
great, and you perform wonders. You alone are God.
{85:11} Lead me, O Lord, in your way, and I will walk in
your truth. May my heart rejoice, so that it will fear your
name. {85:12} I will confess to you, O Lord my God, with
my whole heart. And I will glorify your name in eternity.
{85:13} For your mercy toward me is great, and you have
rescued my soul from the lower part of Hell. {85:14} O God,
the iniquitous have risen up against me, and the synagogue of
the powerful have sought my soul, and they have not placed
you in their sight. {85:15} And you, Lord God, are
compassionate and merciful, being patient and full of mercy
and truthful. {85:16} Look down upon me and have mercy
on me. Grant your authority to your servant, and bring
salvation to the son of your handmaid. {85:17} Make me a
sign of what is good, so that those who hate me, may look
and be confounded. For you, O Lord, have helped me and
consoled me.


)Evening Prayer

[Psalm 86] (Psalm 87) {86:1} A Canticle Psalm to the sons of
Korah. Its foundations are in the holy mountains: {86:2} the
Lord loves the gates of Zion above all the tabernacles of
Jacob. {86:3} Glorious things are being said of you, O City of
God. {86:4} I will be mindful of Rahab and of Babylon
knowing me. Behold, the foreigners, and Tyre, and the
people of the Ethiopians: these have been there. {86:5} Will
not Zion say that this man and that man were born in her?
And the Most High himself has founded her. {86:6} The
Lord will explain, in the writings of peoples and of leaders,
about those who have been in her. {86:7} For so the dwelling
place within you is with all rejoicing.


[Psalm 87] (Psalm 88) {87:1} A Canticle Psalm to the sons of
Korah. Unto the end. For Mahalath, to answer the
understanding of Heman the Ezrahite. {87:2} O Lord, God
of my salvation: I have cried out, day and night, in your
presence. {87:3} Let my prayer enter in your sight. Incline
your ear to my petition. {87:4} For my soul has been filled
with evils, and my life has drawn near to Hell. {87:5} I am
considered to be among those who will descend into the pit. I
have become like a man without assistance, {87:6} idle
among the dead. I am like the wounded sleeping in
sepulchers, whom you no longer remember, and who have
been repelled by your hand. {87:7} They have lain me in the
lower pit: in dark places and in the shadow of death.
{87:8} Your fury has been confirmed over me. And you have
brought all your waves upon me. {87:9} You have sent my
acquaintances far from me. They have set me as an
abomination to themselves. I was handed over, yet I did not
depart. {87:10} My eyes languished before destitution. All
day long, I cried out to you, O Lord. I stretched out my
hands to you. {87:11} Will you perform wonders for the dead?
Or will physicians raise to life, and so confess to you?
{87:12} Could anyone declare your mercy in the sepulcher,
or your truth from within perdition? {87:13} Will your
wonders be known in the darkness, or your justice in the land
of oblivion? {87:14} And I have cried out to you, O Lord,
and in early morning, my prayer will come before you.
{87:15} Lord, why do you reject my prayer? Why do you
turn your face away from me? {87:16} I am poor, and I have
been amid hardships from my youth. And, though I have
been exalted, I am humbled and disturbed. {87:17} Your
wrath has crossed into me, and your terrors have disturbed
me. {87:18} They have surrounded me like water, all day
long. They have surrounded me, all at once. {87:19} Friend
and neighbor, and my acquaintances, you have sent far away
from me, away from misery.


[Gospel Canticle} “My soul magnifies
the Lord. {1:47} And my spirit leaps for joy in God my
Saviour. {1:48} For he has looked with favor on the humility
of his handmaid. For behold, from this time, all generations
shall call me blessed. {1:49} For he who is great has done
great things for me, and holy is his name. {1:50} And his
mercy is from generation to generations for those who fear
him. {1:51} He has accomplished powerful deeds with his
arm. He has scattered the arrogant in the intentions of their
heart. {1:52} He has deposed the powerful from their seat,
and he has exalted the humble. {1:53} He has filled the
hungry with good things, and the rich he has sent away
empty. {1:54} He has taken up his servant Israel, mindful of
his mercy, {1:55} just as he spoke to our fathers: to Abraham
and to his offspring forever.”


)Night Prayer

[Psalm 88] (Psalm 89) {88:1} The understanding of Ethan
the Ezrahite. {88:2} I will sing the mercies of the Lord in
eternity. I will announce your truth with my mouth, from
generation to generation. {88:3} For you have said: Mercy
will be built in the heavens, unto eternity. Your truth will be
prepared there. {88:4} I have set up a covenant with my elect.
I have sworn to David my servant: {88:5} I will prepare your
offspring, even in eternity. And I will build up your throne,
from generation to generation. {88:6} The heavens will
confess your miracles, Lord, and also your truth, in the
Church of the saints. {88:7} For who among the clouds is
equal to the Lord? Who among the sons of God is like God?
{88:8} God is glorified by the counsel of the saints. He is
great and terrible above all those who are around him.
{88:9} O Lord, God of hosts, who is like you? You are
powerful, Lord, and your truth is all around you.
{88:10} You rule over the power of the sea, and you even
mitigate the movement of its waves. {88:11} You have
humbled the arrogant one, like one who has been wounded.
You have scattered your enemies with the arm of your
strength. {88:12} Yours are the heavens, and yours is the
earth. You founded the whole world in all its fullness.
{88:13} You created the north and the sea. Tabor and
Hermon will exult in your name. {88:14} Your arm acts with
power. Let your hand be strengthened, and let your right
hand be exalted. {88:15} Justice and judgment are the
preparation of your throne. Mercy and truth will precede
your face. {88:16} Blessed is the people that knows jubilation.
They will walk in the light of your countenance, O Lord,
{88:17} and they will exult in your name all day long, and
they will be exalted in your justice. {88:18} For you are the
glory of their virtue, and in your goodness, our horn will be
exalted. {88:19} For our assumption is of the Lord, and it is
of our king, the holy one of Israel. {88:20} Then you spoke in
a vision to your holy ones, and you said: I have stationed
help with the powerful one, and I have exalted the elect one
from my people. {88:21} I have found my servant David. I
have anointed him with my holy oil. {88:22} For my hand
will assist him, and my arm will fortify him. {88:23} The
enemy will have no advantage over him, nor will the son of
iniquity be positioned to harm him. {88:24} And I will cut
down his enemies before his face. And those who hate him, I
will turn to flight. {88:25} And my truth and my mercy will
be with him. And his horn will be exalted in my name.
{88:26} And I will place his hand on the sea and his right
hand on the rivers. {88:27} He will invoke me: “You are my
father, my God, and the support of my salvation.”
{88:28} And I will make him the first-born, preeminent
before the kings of the earth. {88:29} I will preserve my
mercy for him eternally, and my covenant for him faithfully.
{88:30} And I will set his offspring from generation to
generation, and his throne like the days of heaven.
{88:31} But if his sons abandon my law, and if they do not
walk in my judgments, {88:32} if they profane my justices,
and if they do not keep my commandments: {88:33} I will
visit their iniquities with a rod, and their sins with a beating.
{88:34} But I will not scatter my mercy from him, and I will
not do harm to my truth. {88:35} And I will not profane my
covenant, and I will not make void that which proceeds from
my lips. {88:36} I have sworn by my holiness one time: I will
not lie to David, {88:37} his offspring will remain for eternity.
And his throne will be like the sun in my sight, {88:38} and,
like the moon, it is perfected in eternity, and it is a faithful
witness in heaven. {88:39} Yet, truly, you have rejected and
despised, you have pushed away, my Christ. {88:40} You
have overthrown the covenant of your servant. You have
profaned his sanctuary on earth. {88:41} You have destroyed
all his fences. You have made his territory dreadful.
{88:42} All who pass by the way have plundered him. He has
become a disgrace to his neighbors. {88:43} You have
exalted the right hand of those who oppress him. You have
brought joy to all his enemies. {88:44} You have diverted the
help of his sword, and you have not assisted him in battle.
{88:45} You have torn him away from cleansing, and you
have smashed his throne down to the ground. {88:46} You
have reduced the days of his time. You have flooded him
with confusion. {88:47} How long, O Lord? Will you turn
away unto the end? Will your wrath flare up like a fire?
{88:48} Remember what my substance is. For could you
really have appointed all the sons of men in vain?
{88:49} Who is the man that will live, and yet not see death?
Who will rescue his own soul from the hand of the
underworld? {88:50} O Lord, where are your mercies of
antiquity, just as you swore to David in your truth?
{88:51} Be mindful, O Lord, of the disgrace of your servants
(which I have sustained in my sinews) among many nations.
{88:52} With these, your enemies have reproached you, O
Lord; with these, they have reproached the commutation of
your Christ. {88:53} Blessed is the Lord for all eternity.
Amen. Amen.


[Gospel Canticle] {2:29} “Now you may dismiss your servant in peace, O Lord,
according to your word. {2:30} For my eyes have seen your
salvation, {2:31} which you have prepared before the face of
all peoples: {2:32} the light of revelation to the nations and
the glory of your people Israel.”

[Psalm 89] (Psalm 90) {89:1} A prayer of Moses, the man of
God. O Lord, you have been our refuge from generation to
generation. {89:2} Before the mountains became, or the land
was formed along with the world: from ages past, even to all
ages, you are God. {89:3} And, lest man be turned aside in
humiliation, you have said: Be converted, O sons of men.
{89:4} For a thousand years before your eyes are like the
days of yesterday, which have passed by, and they are like a
watch of the night, {89:5} which was held for nothing: so
their years shall be. {89:6} In the morning, he may pass away
like grass; in the morning, he may flower and pass away. In
the evening, he will fall, and harden, and become dry.
{89:7} For, at your wrath, we have withered away, and we
have been disturbed by your fury. {89:8} You have placed
our iniquities in your sight, our age in the illumination of
your countenance. {89:9} For all our days have faded away,
and at your wrath, we have fainted. Our years will be
considered to be like a spider’s web. {89:10} The days of our
years in them are seventy years. But in the powerful, they are
eighty years, and more of these are with hardship and sorrow.
For mildness has overwhelmed us, and we shall be corrected.
{89:11} Who knows the power of your wrath? And, before
fear, can your wrath {89:12} be numbered? So make known
your right hand, along with men learned in heart, in wisdom.
{89:13} Return, O Lord, how long? And may you be
persuaded on behalf of your servants. {89:14} We were filled
in the morning with your mercy, and we exulted and
delighted all our days. {89:15} We have been rejoicing,
because of the days in which you humbled us, because of the
years in which we saw evils. {89:16} Look down upon your
servants and upon their works, and direct their sons.
{89:17} And may the splendor of the Lord our God be upon
us. And so, direct the works of our hands over us; direct even
the work of our hands.


[Psalm 90] (Psalm 91) {90:1} The Praise of a Canticle, of
David. Whoever dwells with the assistance of the Most High
will abide in the protection of the God of heaven. {90:2} He
will say to the Lord, “You are my supporter and my refuge.”
My God, I will hope in him. {90:3} For he has freed me from
the snare of those who go hunting, and from the harsh word.
{90:4} He will overshadow you with his shoulders, and you
will hope under his wings. {90:5} His truth will surround you
with a shield. You will not be afraid: before the terror of the
night, {90:6} before the arrow flying in the day, before the
troubles that wander in the darkness, nor of invasion and the
midday demon. {90:7} A thousand will fall before your side
and ten thousand before your right hand. Yet it will not draw
near you. {90:8} So then, truly, you will consider with your
eyes, and you will see the retribution of sinners. {90:9} For
you, O Lord, are my hope. You have set the Most High as
your refuge. {90:10} Disaster will not draw near to you, and
the scourge will not approach your tabernacle. {90:11} For
he has given his Angels charge over you, so as to preserve
you in all your ways. {90:12} With their hands, they will
carry you, lest you hurt your foot against a stone.
{90:13} You will walk over the asp and the king serpent, and
you will trample the lion and the dragon. {90:14} Because he
has hoped in me, I will free him. I will protect him because
he has known my name. {90:15} He will cry out to me, and I
will heed him. I am with him in tribulation. I will rescue him,
and I will glorify him. {90:16} I will fill him with length of
days. And I will reveal to him my salvation.


)Morning Prayer

[Psalm 91] (Psalm 92) {91:1} A Canticle Psalm. On the day
of the Sabbath. {91:2} It is good to confess to the Lord and to
sing psalms to your name, O Most High: {91:3} to announce
your mercy in the morning, and your truth throughout the
night, {91:4} upon the ten strings, upon the psaltery, with a
canticle, upon stringed instruments. {91:5} For you, O Lord,
have delighted me with your doings, and I will exult in the
works of your hands. {91:6} How great are your works, O
Lord! Your thoughts have been made exceedingly deep.
{91:7} A foolish man will not know these things, and a
senseless one will not understand: {91:8} when sinners will
have risen up like grass, and when all those who work
iniquity will have appeared, that they shall pass away, age
after age. {91:9} But you, O Lord, are the Most High for all
eternity. {91:10} For behold your enemies, O Lord, for
behold your enemies will perish, and all those who work
iniquity will be dispersed. {91:11} And my horn will be
exalted like that of the single-horned beast, and my old age
will be exalted in fruitful mercy. {91:12} And my eye has
looked down upon my enemies, and my ear will hear of the
malignant rising up against me. {91:13} The just one will
flourish like the palm tree. He will be multiplied like the
cedar of Lebanon. {91:14} Those planted in the house of the
Lord will flourish in the courts of the house of our God.
{91:15} They will still be multiplied in a fruitful old age, and
they will endure well, {91:16} so that they may announce
that the Lord our God is righteous and that there is no
iniquity in him.


[Psalm 92] (Psalm 93) {92:1} The Praise of a Canticle, of
David himself. In the time before the Sabbath, when the earth
was founded. {92:2} The Lord has reigned. He has been
clothed with beauty. {92:3} The Lord has been clothed with
strength, and he has girded himself. Yet he has also
confirmed the world, which will not be moved. {92:4} My
throne is prepared from of old. You are from everlasting.
{92:5} The floods have lifted up, O Lord, the floods have
lifted up their voice. The floods have lifted up their waves,
{92:6} before the noise of many waters. Wondrous are the
surges of the sea; wondrous is the Lord on high. {92:7} Your
testimonies have been made exceedingly trustworthy.
Sanctity befits your house, O Lord, with length of days.


[Gospel Canticle] {1:68} “Blessed is the Lord God of Israel. For he has
visited and has wrought the redemption of his people.
{1:69} And he has raised up a horn of salvation for us, in the
house of David his servant, {1:70} just as he spoke by the
mouth of his holy Prophets, who are from ages past:
{1:71} salvation from our enemies, and from the hand of all
those who hate us, {1:72} to accomplish mercy with our
fathers, and to call to mind his holy testament, {1:73} the
oath, which he swore to Abraham, our father, that he would
grant to us, {1:74} so that, having been freed from the hand
of our enemies, we may serve him without fear, {1:75} in
holiness and in justice before him, throughout all our days.
{1:76} And you, child, shall be called the prophet of the Most
High. For you will go before the face of the Lord: to prepare
his ways, {1:77} to give knowledge of salvation to his people
for the remission of their sins, {1:78} through the heart of the
mercy of our God, by which, descending from on high, he
has visited us, {1:79} to illuminate those who sit in darkness
and in the shadow of death, and to direct our feet in the way
of peace.”


)Midday Prayer

[Psalm 93] (Psalm 94) {93:1} A Psalm of David himself. The
Fourth Sabbath. The Lord is the God of retribution. The God
of retribution acts in order to deliver. {93:2} Lift yourself up,
for you judge the earth. Repay the arrogant with retribution.
{93:3} How long will sinners, O Lord, how long will sinners
glory? {93:4} How long will they utter and speak iniquity?
How long will all who work injustice speak out? {93:5} They
have humiliated your people, O Lord, and they have
harassed your inheritance. {93:6} They have executed the
widow and the new arrival, and they have slaughtered the
orphan. {93:7} And they have said, “The Lord will not see,
nor will the God of Jacob understand.” {93:8} Understand,
you senseless ones among the people. And be wise at last,
you foolish ones. {93:9} He who formed the ear, will he not
hear? And he who forged the eye, does he not look closely?
{93:10} He who chastises nations, he who teaches man
knowledge, will he not rebuke? {93:11} The Lord knows the
thoughts of men: that these are in vain. {93:12} Blessed is the
man whom you will instruct, O Lord. And you will teach
him from your law. {93:13} So may you soothe him from the
evil days, until a pit may be dug for sinners. {93:14} For the
Lord will not drive away his people, and he will not abandon
his inheritance, {93:15} even until the time when justice is
being converted into judgment, and when those who are
close to justice are all those who are upright of heart.
{93:16} Who will rise up with me against the malignant? Or
who will stand with me against the workers of iniquity?
{93:17} Except that the Lord assisted me, my soul almost
would have dwelt in Hell. {93:18} If ever I said, “My foot is
slipping,” then your mercy, O Lord, assisted me.
{93:19} According to the multitude of my sorrows in my
heart, your consolations have given joy to my soul.
{93:20} Does the seat of iniquity adhere to you, you who
contrive hardship within a commandment? {93:21} They will
hunt down the soul of the just, and they will condemn
innocent blood. {93:22} And the Lord has been made into a
refuge for me, and my God into the assistance of my hope.
{93:23} And he will repay them their iniquity, and he will
destroy them in their malice. The Lord our God will utterly
destroy them.


)Evening Prayer

[Psalm 94] (Psalm 95) {94:1} The Praise of a Canticle, of
David himself. Come, let us exult in the Lord. Let us shout
joyfully to God, our Savior. {94:2} Let us anticipate his
presence with confession, and let us sing joyfully to him with
psalms. {94:3} For the Lord is a great God and a great King
over all gods. {94:4} For in his hand are all the limits of the
earth, and the heights of the mountains are his. {94:5} For
the sea is his, and he made it, and his hands formed the dry
land. {94:6} Come, let us adore and fall prostrate, and let us
weep before the Lord who made us. {94:7} For he is the Lord
our God, and we are the people of his pasture and the sheep
of his hand. {94:8} If today you hear his voice, harden not
your hearts: {94:9} as in the provocation, according to the
day of temptation in the wilderness, where your fathers
tempted me; they tested me, though they had seen my works.
{94:10} For forty years, I was offended by that generation,
and I said: These have always strayed in heart. {94:11} And
these have not known my ways. So I swore in my wrath:
They shall not enter into my rest.


[Psalm 95] (Psalm 96) {95:1} A Canticle of David himself,
when the house was built after the captivity. Sing to the Lord
a new song. Sing to the Lord, all the earth. {95:2} Sing to the
Lord and bless his name. Announce his salvation from day to
day. {95:3} Announce his glory among the Gentiles, his
miracles among all peoples. {95:4} For the Lord is great and
greatly to be praised. He is terrible, beyond all gods.
{95:5} For all the gods of the Gentiles are demons, but the
Lord made the heavens. {95:6} Confession and beauty are in
his sight. Sanctity and magnificence are in his sanctuary.
{95:7} Bring to the Lord, you natives of the nations, bring to
the Lord glory and honor. {95:8} Bring to the Lord glory for
his name. Lift up sacrifices, and enter into his courts.
{95:9} Adore the Lord in his holy court. Let the entire earth
be shaken before his face. {95:10} Say among the Gentiles:
The Lord has reigned. For he has even corrected the whole
world, which will not be shaken. He will judge the peoples
with fairness. {95:11} Let the heavens rejoice, and let the
earth exult; let the sea and all its fullness be moved.
{95:12} The fields and all the things that are in them will be
glad. Then all the trees of the forest will rejoice
{95:13} before the face of the Lord: for he arrives. For he
arrives to judge the earth. He will judge the whole world with
fairness and the peoples with his truth.


[Gospel Canticle} “My soul magnifies
the Lord. {1:47} And my spirit leaps for joy in God my
Saviour. {1:48} For he has looked with favor on the humility
of his handmaid. For behold, from this time, all generations
shall call me blessed. {1:49} For he who is great has done
great things for me, and holy is his name. {1:50} And his
mercy is from generation to generations for those who fear
him. {1:51} He has accomplished powerful deeds with his
arm. He has scattered the arrogant in the intentions of their
heart. {1:52} He has deposed the powerful from their seat,
and he has exalted the humble. {1:53} He has filled the
hungry with good things, and the rich he has sent away
empty. {1:54} He has taken up his servant Israel, mindful of
his mercy, {1:55} just as he spoke to our fathers: to Abraham
and to his offspring forever.”


)Night Prayer

[Psalm 96] (Psalm 97) {96:1} This is to David, when his land
was restored to him. The Lord has reigned, let the earth exult.
Let the many islands rejoice. {96:2} Clouds and mist are all
around him. Justice and judgment are corrections from his
throne. {96:3} A fire will precede him, and it will enflame his
enemies all around. {96:4} His lightnings have enlightened
the whole world. The earth saw, and it was shaken.
{96:5} The mountains flowed like wax before the face of the
Lord, before the face of the Lord of all the earth. {96:6} The
heavens announced his justice, and all peoples saw his glory.
{96:7} May all those who adore graven images be
confounded, along with those who glory in their false images.
All you his Angels: Adore him. {96:8} Zion heard, and was
glad. And the daughters of Judah exulted because of your
judgments, O Lord. {96:9} For you are the Most High Lord
over all the earth. You are greatly exalted above all gods.
{96:10} You who love the Lord: hate evil. The Lord watches
over the souls of his holy ones. He will free them from the
hand of the sinner. {96:11} The light has risen for the just,
and joy for the upright of heart. {96:12} Rejoice in the Lord,
you just ones, and confess to the memory of his sanctuary.


[Gospel Canticle] {2:29} “Now you may dismiss your servant in peace, O Lord,
according to your word. {2:30} For my eyes have seen your
salvation, {2:31} which you have prepared before the face of
all peoples: {2:32} the light of revelation to the nations and
the glory of your people Israel.”

to the Lord a new song, for he has performed wonders. His
right hand has accomplished salvation for him, with his holy
arm. {97:2} The Lord has made known his salvation. He has

Israel. All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our
God. {97:4} Sing joyfully to God, all the earth. Sing and
exult, and sing psalms. {97:5} Sing psalms to the Lord with
stringed instruments, with strings and the voice of a psalmist,

{98:4} And the honor of the king loves judgment. You have
prepared guidance. You have accomplished judgment and
justice in Jacob. {98:5} Exalt the Lord our God, and adore
the footstool of his feet, for it is holy. {98:6} Moses and
Aaron are among his priests, and Samuel is among those who
call upon his name. They called upon the Lord, and he
heeded them. {98:7} He spoke to them in the pillar of the
cloud. They kept his testimonies and the precept that he gave
them. {98:8} You heeded them, O Lord our God. You were
a forgiving God to them, though taking vengeance on all
their inventions. {98:9} Exalt the Lord our God, and adore
on his holy mountain. For the Lord our God is holy.

[Psalm 99] (Psalm 100) {99:1} A Psalm of Confession.
{99:2} Shout joyfully to God, all the earth. Serve the Lord
with rejoicing. Enter into his sight in exultation.
{99:3} Know that the Lord himself is God. He made us, and
we ourselves did not. We are his people and the sheep of his
pasture. {99:4} Enter his gates with confession, his courts
with hymns, and acknowledge him. Praise his name.
{99:5} For the Lord is sweet, his mercy is in eternity, and his
truth is from generation to generation.


[Psalm 100] (Psalm 101) {100:1} A Psalm of David himself.
I will sing mercy and judgment to you, O Lord. I will sing
psalms. {100:2} And I will have understanding within the
immaculate way, when you will draw near to me. I wandered
about in the innocence of my heart, in the midst of my house.
{100:3} I will not display any unjust thing before my eyes. I
have hated those carrying out betrayals. {100:4} The perverse
heart did not adhere to me. And the malignant, who turned
away before me, I would not recognize. {100:5} The one
who secretly detracted his neighbor, this one I pursued. The
one with an arrogant eye and an insatiable heart, with that
one I would not eat. {100:6} My eyes looked toward the
faithful of the earth, to sit with me. The one walking in the
immaculate way, this one ministered to me. {100:7} He who
has acted arrogantly will not dwell in the midst of my house.
He who has spoken iniquity was not guided with the sight of
my eyes. {100:8} In the morning, I executed all the sinners of
the earth, so that I might scatter all the workers of iniquity
from the city of the Lord.


[Gospel Canticle] {1:68} “Blessed is the Lord God of Israel. For he has

)Midday Prayer

[Psalm 101] (Psalm 102) {101:1} The prayer of the pauper,
when he was anxious, and so he poured out his petition in
the sight of the Lord. {101:2} O Lord, hear my prayer, and
let my outcry reach you. {101:3} Do not turn your face away
from me. In whatever day that I am in trouble, incline your
ear to me. In whatever day that I will call upon you, heed me
quickly. {101:4} For my days have faded away like smoke,
and my bones have dried out like firewood. {101:5} I have
been cut down like hay, and my heart has withered, for I had
forgotten to eat my bread. {101:6} Before the voice of my
groaning, my bone has adhered to my flesh. {101:7} I have
become like a pelican in solitude. I have become like a night
raven in a house. {101:8} I have kept vigil, and I have
become like a solitary sparrow on a roof. {101:9} All day
long my enemies reproached me, and those who praised me
swore oaths against me. {101:10} For I chewed on ashes like
bread, and I mixed weeping into my drink. {101:11} By the
face of your anger and indignation, you lifted me up and
threw me down. {101:12} My days have declined like a
shadow, and I have dried out like hay. {101:13} But you, O
Lord, endure for eternity, and your memorial is from
generation to generation. {101:14} You will rise up and take
pity on Zion, for it is time for its mercy, for the time has
come. {101:15} For its stones have pleased your servants,
and they will take pity on its land. {101:16} And the Gentiles
will fear your name, O Lord, and all the kings of the earth
your glory. {101:17} For the Lord has built up Zion, and he
will be seen in his glory. {101:18} He has noticed of the
prayer of the humble, and he has not despised their petition.
{101:19} Let these things be written in another generation,
and the people who will be created will praise the Lord.
{101:20} For he has gazed from his high sanctuary. From
heaven, the Lord has beheld the earth. {101:21} So may he
hear the groans of those in shackles, in order that he may
release the sons of the slain. {101:22} So may they announce
the name of the Lord in Zion and his praise in Jerusalem:
{101:23} while the people convene, along with kings, in
order that they may serve the Lord. {101:24} He responded
to him in the way of his virtue: Declare to me the brevity of
my days. {101:25} Do not call me back in the middle of my
days: your years are from generation to generation.
{101:26} In the beginning, O Lord, you founded the earth.
And the heavens are the work of your hands. {101:27} They
will perish, but you remain. And all will grow old like a
garment. And, like a blanket, you will change them, and they
will be changed. {101:28} Yet you are ever yourself, and your
years will not decline. {101:29} The sons of your servants
will live, and their offspring will be guided aright in every age.


)Evening Prayer

[Psalm 102] (Psalm 103) {102:1} To David himself. Bless the
Lord, O my soul, and bless his holy name, all that is within
me. {102:2} Bless the Lord, O my soul, and do not forget all
his recompenses. {102:3} He forgives all your iniquities. He
heals all your infirmities. {102:4} He redeems your life from
destruction. He crowns you with mercy and compassion.
{102:5} He satisfies your desire with good things. Your youth
will be renewed like that of the eagle. {102:6} The Lord
accomplishes mercies, and his judgment is for all who
patiently endure injuries. {102:7} He has made his ways
known to Moses, his will to the sons of Israel. {102:8} The
Lord is compassionate and merciful, patient and full of mercy.
{102:9} He will not be angry forever, and he will not threaten
for eternity. {102:10} He has not dealt with us according to
our sins, and he has not repaid us according to our iniquities.
{102:11} For according to the height of the heavens above
the earth, so has he reinforced his mercy toward those who
fear him. {102:12} As far as the east is from the west, so far
has he removed our iniquities from us. {102:13} As a father is
compassionate to his sons, so has the Lord been
compassionate to those who fear him. {102:14} For he
knows our form. He has called to mind that we are dust.
{102:15} Man: his days are like hay. Like the flower of the
field, so will he flourish. {102:16} For the spirit in him will
pass away, and it will not remain, and he will know his place
no longer. {102:17} But the mercy of the Lord is from
eternity, and even unto eternity, upon those who fear him.
And his justice is with the sons of the sons, {102:18} with
those who serve his covenant and have been mindful of his
commandments by doing them. {102:19} The Lord has
prepared his throne in heaven, and his kingdom will rule over
all. {102:20} Bless the Lord, all you his Angels: powerful in
virtue, doing his word, in order to heed the voice of his
discourse. {102:21} Bless the Lord, all his hosts: his ministers
who do his will. {102:22} Bless the Lord, all his works: in
every place of his dominion. Bless the Lord, O my soul.


[Psalm 103] (Psalm 104) {103:1} To David himself. Bless the
Lord, O my soul. O Lord my God, you are exceedingly great.
You have clothed yourself with confession and beauty;
{103:2} you are dressed with light like a garment, while you
stretch out heaven like a tent. {103:3} You cover its heights
with water. You set the clouds as your stairs. You walk upon
the wings of the winds. {103:4} You make your Angels a
breath of life, and your ministers a burning fire. {103:5} You
founded the earth upon its stable base. It will not be bent
from age to age. {103:6} The abyss, like a garment, is its
clothing. The waters will remain standing above the
mountains. {103:7} At your rebuke, they will flee. At the
voice of your thunder, they will dread. {103:8} The
mountains ascend, and the plains descend, to the place which
you have founded for them. {103:9} You have set a limit that
they will not cross. And they will not return to cover the
earth. {103:10} You spring forth fountains in steep valleys.
The waters will cross through the midst of the mountains.
{103:11} All the wild beasts of the field will drink. The wild
donkeys will anticipate in their thirst. {103:12} Above them,
the flying things of the air will dwell. From the midst of the
rocks, they will utter voices. {103:13} You irrigate the
mountains from your heights. The earth will be satiated from
the fruit of your works, {103:14} producing grass for cattle
and herbs for the service of men. So may you draw bread
from the earth, {103:15} and wine, in order to cheer the heart
of man. Then he may gladden his face with oil, and bread
will confirm the heart of man. {103:16} The trees of the field
will be saturated, along with the cedars of Lebanon, which he
planted. {103:17} There, the sparrows will make their nests.
The leader of them is the house of the heron. {103:18} The
heights of the hills are for the deer; the rock is a refuge for the
hedgehog. {103:19} He has made the moon for seasons; the
sun knows its setting. {103:20} You appointed darkness, and
it has become night; all the beasts of the forest will cross
through it. {103:21} The young lions will roar, while
searching for and seizing their meal from God. {103:22} The
sun arose, and they were gathered together; and in their dens,
they will lie down together. {103:23} Man will go forth to his
work and to his activities, until the evening. {103:24} How
great are your works, O Lord! You have made all things in
wisdom. The earth has been filled with your possessions.
{103:25} This sea is great and its hands are spacious. There
are creeping things without number: the small animals with
the great. {103:26} There, the ships will pass by this sea-
serpent that you have formed to mock them. {103:27} All
these expect you to give them food in due time.
{103:28} What you give to them, they will gather. When you
open your hand, they will all be filled with goodness.
{103:29} But if you turn your face away, they will be
disturbed. You will take away their breath, and they will fail,
and they will return to their dust. {103:30} You will send
forth your Spirit, and they will be created. And you will
renew the face of the earth. {103:31} May the glory of the
Lord be for all ages. The Lord will rejoice in his works.
{103:32} He considers the earth, and he makes it tremble. He
touches the mountains, and they smoke. {103:33} I will sing
to the Lord with my life. I will sing psalms to my God, as
long as I am. {103:34} May my speech be pleasing to him.
Truly, I will take delight in the Lord. {103:35} Let sinners
fade away from the earth, along with the unjust, so that they
may not be. Bless the Lord, O my soul.


[Gospel Canticle} “My soul magnifies
the Lord. {1:47} And my spirit leaps for joy in God my
Saviour. {1:48} For he has looked with favor on the humility
of his handmaid. For behold, from this time, all generations
shall call me blessed. {1:49} For he who is great has done
great things for me, and holy is his name. {1:50} And his
mercy is from generation to generations for those who fear
him. {1:51} He has accomplished powerful deeds with his
arm. He has scattered the arrogant in the intentions of their
heart. {1:52} He has deposed the powerful from their seat,
and he has exalted the humble. {1:53} He has filled the
hungry with good things, and the rich he has sent away
empty. {1:54} He has taken up his servant Israel, mindful of
his mercy, {1:55} just as he spoke to our fathers: to Abraham
and to his offspring forever.”


)Night Prayer

[Psalm 104] (Psalm 105) {104:1} Alleluia. Confess to the
Lord, and invoke his name. Announce his works among the
nations. {104:2} Sing to him, and sing psalms to him.
Describe all his wonders. {104:3} Be praised in his holy name.
Let the heart of those who seek the Lord rejoice.
{104:4} Seek the Lord, and be confirmed. Seek his face
always. {104:5} Remember his miracles, which he has done,
his portents and the judgments of his mouth: {104:6} you
offspring of Abraham his servant, you sons of Jacob his elect.
{104:7} He is the Lord our God. His judgments are
throughout the entire earth. {104:8} He has remembered his
covenant for all ages: the word that he entrusted to a
thousand generations, {104:9} which he assigned to
Abraham, and his oath to Isaac. {104:10} And he stationed
the same for Jacob with a precept, and for Israel with an
eternal testament, {104:11} saying: To you, I will give the
land of Canaan, the allotment of your inheritance.
{104:12} Though they may have been but a small number,
very few and foreigners there, {104:13} and though they
passed from nation to nation, and from one kingdom to
another people, {104:14} he allowed no man to harm them,
and he reproved kings on their behalf. {104:15} Do not be
willing to touch my Christ, and do not be willing to malign
my prophets. {104:16} And he called a famine upon the land,
and he crushed every foundation of the bread. {104:17} He
sent a man before them: Joseph, who had been sold as a slave.
{104:18} They humbled his feet in shackles; the iron pierced
his soul, {104:19} until his word arrived. The eloquence of
the Lord inflamed him. {104:20} The king sent and released
him; he was the ruler of the people, and he dismissed him.
{104:21} He established him as master of his house and ruler
of all his possessions, {104:22} so that he might instruct his
princes as himself, and teach his elders prudence.
{104:23} And Israel entered into Egypt, and Jacob became a
sojourner in the land of Ham. {104:24} And he helped his
people greatly, and he strengthened them over their enemies.
{104:25} He turned their heart to hate his people, and to deal
deceitfully with his servants. {104:26} He sent Moses, his
servant, and Aaron, the one whom he chose. {104:27} He
placed with them signs of his word, and portents in the land
of Ham. {104:28} He sent darkness and made it conceal, and
he did not afflict them with his speech. {104:29} He turned
their waters into blood, and he slaughtered their fish.
{104:30} Their land brought forth frogs, even in the inner
chambers of their kings. {104:31} He spoke, and there came
forth common flies and gnats, in every region. {104:32} He
gave them a shower of hail and a burning fire, in the same
land. {104:33} And he struck their vineyards and their fig
trees, and he crushed the trees of their region. {104:34} He
spoke, and the locust came forth, and the caterpillar, of which
there was no number. {104:35} And it devoured all the grass
in their land, and it consumed all the fruit of their land.
{104:36} And he struck all the first-born in their land, the
first-fruits of all their labor. {104:37} And he led them out
with silver and gold, and there was not an infirm one among
their tribes. {104:38} Egypt was joyful at their departure, for
the fear of them lay heavy upon them. {104:39} He spread a
cloud for their protection, and a fire, to give them light
through the night. {104:40} They petitioned, and the quail
came; and he satisfied them with the bread of heaven.
{104:41} He ruptured the rock and the waters flowed: rivers
gushed in the dry land. {104:42} For he had called to mind
his holy word, which he kept near to his servant Abraham.
{104:43} And he led forth his people in exultation, and his
elect in rejoicing. {104:44} And he gave them the regions of
the Gentiles, and they possessed the labors of the peoples,
{104:45} so that they might observe his justifications, and
inquire about his law.


[Gospel Canticle] {2:29} “Now you may dismiss your servant in peace, O Lord,
according to your word. {2:30} For my eyes have seen your
salvation, {2:31} which you have prepared before the face of
all peoples: {2:32} the light of revelation to the nations and
the glory of your people Israel.”

)Office of Readings

[Psalm 105] (Psalm 106) {105:1} Alleluia. Confess to the
Lord, for he is good, for his mercy is with every generation.
{105:2} Who will declare the powers of the Lord? Who make
a hearing for all his praises? {105:3} Blessed are those who
keep judgment and who do justice at all times.
{105:4} Remember us, O Lord, with good will for your
people. Visit us with your salvation, {105:5} so that we may
see the goodness of your elect, so that we may rejoice in the
joy of your nation, so that you may be praised along with
your inheritance. {105:6} We have sinned, as have our
fathers. We have acted unjustly; we have wrought iniquity.
{105:7} Our fathers did not understand your miracles in
Egypt. They did not remember the multitude of your mercies.
And they provoked you, while going up to the sea, even the
Red Sea. {105:8} And he saved them for the sake of his name,
so that he might make known his power. {105:9} And he
rebuked the Red Sea, and it dried up. And he led them into
the abyss, as if into a desert. {105:10} And he saved them
from the hand of those who hated them. And he redeemed
them from the hand of the enemy. {105:11} And the water
covered those who troubled them. Not one of them remained.
{105:12} And they believed his words, and they sang his
praises. {105:13} As soon as they had finished, they forgot
his works, and they would not endure his counsel.
{105:14} And they coveted their desire in the desert, and they
tempted God in a waterless place. {105:15} And he granted
to them their request, and he sent abundance into their souls.
{105:16} And they provoked Moses in the camp, and Aaron,
the holy one of the Lord. {105:17} The earth opened and
swallowed Dathan, and it covered the congregation of
Abiram. {105:18} And a fire broke out in their congregation.
A flame burned up the sinners. {105:19} And they fashioned
a calf at Horeb, and they adored a graven image.
{105:20} And they exchanged their glory for the likeness of a
calf that eats hay. {105:21} They forgot God, who saved
them, who did great things in Egypt: {105:22} miracles in the
land of Ham, terrible things at the Red Sea. {105:23} And he
said that he would destroy them, yet Moses, his elect, stood
firm before him in the breach, in order to avert his wrath, lest
he destroy them. {105:24} And they held the desirable land
to be nothing. They did not trust in his word. {105:25} And
they murmured in their tabernacles. They did not heed the
voice of the Lord. {105:26} And he lifted up his hand over
them, in order to prostrate them in the desert, {105:27} and
in order to cast their offspring among the nations, and to
scatter them among the regions. {105:28} And they were
initiated into Baal of Peor, and they ate the sacrifices of the
dead. {105:29} And they provoked him with their inventions,
and ruination was multiplied in them. {105:30} Then
Phinehas stood up and placated him: and so the violent
disturbance ceased. {105:31} And it was reputed to him unto
justice, from generation to generation, even forever.
{105:32} And they provoked him at the Waters of
Contradiction, and Moses was afflicted because of them,
{105:33} for they exasperated his spirit. And so he divided
them with his lips. {105:34} They did not destroy the nations,
about which the Lord had spoken to them. {105:35} And
they were mixed among the Gentiles. And they learned their
works, {105:36} and they served their graven images, and it
became a scandal to them. {105:37} And they sacrificed their
sons and their daughters to demons. {105:38} And they shed
innocent blood: the blood of their sons and of their daughters,
which they sacrificed to the graven images of Canaan. And
the land was infected with bloodshed, {105:39} and was
contaminated with their works. And they fornicated
according to their own inventions. {105:40} And the Lord
became furiously angry with his people, and he abhorred his
inheritance. {105:41} And he delivered them into the hands
of the nations. And those who hated them became rulers over
them. {105:42} And their enemies afflicted them, and they
were humbled under their hands. {105:43} Many times, he
delivered them. Yet they provoked him with their counsel,
and they were brought low by their iniquities. {105:44} And
he saw that they were in tribulation, and he heard their
prayer. {105:45} And he was mindful of his covenant, and he
repented according to the multitude of his mercies.
{105:46} And he provided for them with mercies, in the sight
of all those who had seized them. {105:47} Save us, O Lord
our God, and gather us from the nations, so that we may
confess your holy name and glory in your praise.
{105:48} Blessed is the Lord God of Israel, from ages past,
even to all ages. And let all the people say: Amen. Amen.


[Psalm 106] (Psalm 107) {106:1} Alleluia. Confess to the
Lord, for he is good, for his mercy is with every generation.
{106:2} Let those who have been redeemed by the Lord say
so: those whom he redeemed from the hand of the enemy
and gathered from the regions, {106:3} from the rising of the
sun and its setting, from the north and from the sea.
{106:4} They wandered into solitude in a waterless place.
They did not find the way of the city to be their dwelling
place. {106:5} They were hungry, and they were thirsty.
Their soul fainted within them. {106:6} And they cried out to
the Lord in tribulation, and he rescued them in their necessity.
{106:7} And he led them in the right way, so that they might
go forth to a city of habitation. {106:8} Let his mercies
confess to the Lord, and let his miracles confess to the sons of
men. {106:9} For he has satisfied the empty soul, and he has
satisfied the hungry soul with good things: {106:10} those
sitting in darkness and in the shadow of death, shackled by
extreme poverty and by iron. {106:11} For they exasperated
the eloquence of God, and they irritated the deliberation of
the Most High. {106:12} And their heart was brought low
with hardships. They were weakened, and there was no one
to help them. {106:13} And they cried out to the Lord in
their tribulation, and he freed them from their distress.
{106:14} And he led them out of darkness and the shadow of
death, and he broke apart their chains. {106:15} Let his
mercies confess to the Lord, and let his miracles confess to
the sons of men. {106:16} For he has crushed the gates of
brass and broken the iron bars. {106:17} He has taken them
up, from the way of their iniquity. For they were brought low,
because of their injustices. {106:18} Their soul abhorred all
food, and they drew near even to the gates of death.
{106:19} And they cried out to the Lord in their tribulation,
and he delivered them in their necessity. {106:20} He sent his
word, and he healed them, and he rescued them from their
utter destruction. {106:21} Let his mercies confess to the
Lord, and let his miracles confess to the sons of men.
{106:22} And let them offer sacrifice with the sacrifice of
praise, and let them announce his works in exultation.
{106:23} Those who descend to the sea in ships, making their
livelihood in the great waters: {106:24} these have seen the
works of the Lord and his wonders in the deep. {106:25} He
spoke: and a windstorm stood up, and its waves were exalted.
{106:26} They ascend even to the heavens, and they descend
even to the abyss. Their soul will waste away in distress.
{106:27} They were troubled, and they moved like a
drunkard, and all their wisdom was consumed. {106:28} And
they cried out to the Lord in their tribulation, and he led
them out of their distress. {106:29} And he replaced the
storm with a breeze, and its waves were stilled. {106:30} And
they were joyful that it was stilled, and he led them into the
haven that they desired. {106:31} Let his mercies confess to
the Lord, and let his miracles confess to the sons of men.
{106:32} And let them exalt him in the Church of the people,
and praise him in the chair of the elders. {106:33} He has
placed rivers in the desert and sources of water in dry places,
{106:34} a fruit-bearing land in the midst of brine, before the
malice of those who dwell in it. {106:35} He has placed a
desert in the midst of pools of waters, and a land without
water in the midst of sources of water. {106:36} And he has
gathered the hungry together there, and they constructed a
city of habitation. {106:37} And they sowed fields and
planted vineyards, and they produced the fruit of nativity.
{106:38} And he blessed them, and they were multiplied
exceedingly. And he did not diminish their beasts of burden.
{106:39} And they became few, and they were afflicted by
the tribulation of evils and of sorrow. {106:40} Contempt was
poured over their leaders, and he caused them to wander in
an impassable place, and not on the way. {106:41} And he
helped the poor out of destitution, and he stationed families
like sheep. {106:42} The upright will see, and they will
rejoice. And every iniquity will block its mouth.
{106:43} Who is wise and will keep these things? And who
will understand the mercies of the Lord?


)Morning Prayer

[Psalm 107] (Psalm 108) {107:1} A Canticle Psalm, of David
himself. {107:2} My heart is prepared, O God, my heart is
prepared. I will sing songs, and I will sing psalms in my glory.
{107:3} Rise up, my glory. Rise up, Psalter and harp. I will
arise in early morning. {107:4} I will confess to you, O Lord,
among the peoples. And I will sing psalms to you among the
nations. {107:5} For your mercy is great, beyond the heavens,
and your truth, even to the clouds. {107:6} Be exalted, O
God, beyond the heavens, and your glory, beyond all the
earth, {107:7} so that your beloved may be freed. Save with
your right hand, and heed me. {107:8} God has spoken in his
holiness. I will exult, and I will divide Shechem, and I will
divide by measure the steep valley of tabernacles.
{107:9} Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine, and Ephraim
is the supporter of my head. Judah is my king.
{107:10} Moab is the cooking pot of my hope. I will extend
my shoe in Idumea; the foreigners have become my friends.
{107:11} Who will lead me into the fortified city? Who will
lead me, even into Idumea? {107:12} Will not you, O God,
who had rejected us? And will not you, O God, go out with
our armies? {107:13} Grant us help from tribulation, for vain
is the help of man. {107:14} In God, we will act virtuously,
and he will bring our enemies to nothing.


[Psalm 108] (Psalm 109) {108:1} Unto the end. A Psalm of
David. {108:2} O God, do not be silent toward my praise, for
the mouth of the sinner and the mouth of the deceitful one
have been opened against me. {108:3} They have spoken
against me with deceitful tongues, and they have surrounded
me with hateful words, and they fought against me over
nothing. {108:4} Instead of choosing to act on my behalf,
they detracted me. But I gave myself to prayer. {108:5} And
they set evil against me, instead of good, and hatred, in return
for my love. {108:6} Establish the sinner over him, and let
the devil stand at his right hand. {108:7} When he is judged,
may he go forth in condemnation, and may his prayer be
counted as sin. {108:8} May his days be few, and let another
take his episcopate. {108:9} May his sons be orphans, and his
wife a widow. {108:10} May his sons be carried by those
who walk unsteadily, and may they go begging. And may
they be cast out of their dwelling places. {108:11} May the
money lenders scrutinize all his belongings, and let foreigners
plunder his labors. {108:12} May there be no one to assist
him, nor anyone to be compassionate to his orphaned
children. {108:13} May his posterity be in utter ruin. In one
generation, may his name be wiped away. {108:14} May the
iniquity of his fathers return in memory before the sight of the
Lord, and do not let the sin of his mother be wiped away.
{108:15} May these be opposite the Lord always, but let their
memory perish from the earth. {108:16} For certain things
are not remembered about them, in order to be merciful.
{108:17} And so the destitute man was pursued, with the
beggar and the remorseful in heart, so as to be put to death.
{108:18} And he loved a curse, and it came to him. And he
was unwilling to have a blessing, and it went far from him.
And he clothed himself with curses like a garment, and it
entered his inner self like water, and it entered his bones like
oil. {108:19} May it be to him like a garment that covers him,
and like a belt that always cinches him. {108:20} This is the
work of those who detract me with the Lord and who speak
evils against my soul. {108:21} But as for you, Lord, O Lord:
act on my behalf for your name’s sake. For your mercy is
sweet. {108:22} Free me, for I am destitute and poor, and my
heart has been disquieted within me. {108:23} I have been
taken away like a shadow when it declines, and I have been
shaken off like locusts. {108:24} My knees have been
weakened by fasting, and my flesh has been replaced by oil.
{108:25} And I have become a disgrace to them. They saw
me, and they shook their heads. {108:26} Help me, O Lord,
my God. Save me according to your mercy. {108:27} And let
them know that this is your hand, and that you, O Lord, have
done this. {108:28} They will curse, and you will bless. May
those who rise up against me be confounded. But your
servant will rejoice. {108:29} May those who detract me be
clothed with shame, and may they be covered with their
confusion, as if with a double cloak. {108:30} I will confess
exceedingly to the Lord with my mouth. And I will praise
him in the midst of the multitude. {108:31} For he stands at
the right hand of the poor, in order to save my soul from
persecutors.


[Gospel Canticle] {1:68} “Blessed is the Lord God of Israel. For he has
visited and has wrought the redemption of his people.
{1:69} And he has raised up a horn of salvation for us, in the
house of David his servant, {1:70} just as he spoke by the
mouth of his holy Prophets, who are from ages past:
{1:71} salvation from our enemies, and from the hand of all
those who hate us, {1:72} to accomplish mercy with our
fathers, and to call to mind his holy testament, {1:73} the
oath, which he swore to Abraham, our father, that he would
grant to us, {1:74} so that, having been freed from the hand
of our enemies, we may serve him without fear, {1:75} in
holiness and in justice before him, throughout all our days.
{1:76} And you, child, shall be called the prophet of the Most
High. For you will go before the face of the Lord: to prepare

for the remission of their sins, {1:78} through the heart of the
mercy of our God, by which, descending from on high, he
has visited us, {1:79} to illuminate those who sit in darkness
and in the shadow of death, and to direct our feet in the way

)Midday Prayer

[Psalm 109] (Psalm 110) {109:1} A Psalm of David. The
Lord said to my Lord, “Sit at my right hand, until I make
your enemies your footstool.” {109:2} The Lord will send
forth the scepter of your virtue from Zion. Rule in the midst
of your enemies. {109:3} It is with you from the beginning, in
the day of your virtue, in the splendor of the saints. From
conception, before the light-bearer, I begot you. {109:4} The
Lord has sworn, and he will not repent: “You are a priest
forever, according to the order of Melchizedek.” {109:5} The
Lord is at your right hand. He has broken kings in the day of
his wrath. {109:6} He will judge between the nations; he will
fill up ruination. He will shatter heads in the land of the
many. {109:7} He will drink from the torrent on the way.
Because of this, he will exalt the head.


)Evening Prayer

[Psalm 110] (Psalm 111) {110:1} Alleluia. I will confess to
you, O Lord, with my whole heart, in the council of the just
and in the congregation. {110:2} Great are the works of the
Lord, exquisite in all his intentions. {110:3} Confession and
magnificence are his work. And his justice remains from age
to age. {110:4} He has created a memorial to his wonders; he
is a merciful and compassionate Lord. {110:5} He has given
food to those who fear him. He will be mindful of his
covenant in every age. {110:6} He will announce the virtue of
his works to his people, {110:7} so that he may give them the
inheritance of the nations. The works of his hands are truth
and judgment. {110:8} All his commands are faithful:
confirmed from age to age, created in truth and fairness.
{110:9} He has sent redemption upon his people. He has
commanded his covenant for all eternity. Holy and terrible is
his name. {110:10} The fear of the Lord is the beginning of
wisdom. A good understanding is for all who do it. His praise
remains from age to age.


[Psalm 111] (Psalm 112) {111:1} Alleluia. Of the return of
Haggai and Zachariah. Blessed is the man who fears the Lord.

his house, and his justice shall remain from age to age.

is the man who shows mercy and lends. He will order his
words with judgment. {111:6} For he will not be disturbed in
eternity. {111:7} The just one will be an everlasting memorial.
He will not fear a report of disasters. His heart is prepared to
hope in the Lord. {111:8} His heart has been confirmed. He
will not be disturbed, until he looks down upon his enemies.
{111:9} He has distributed, he has given to the poor. His
justice shall remain from age to age. His horn shall be exalted
in glory. {111:10} The sinner will see and become angry. He
will gnash his teeth and waste away. The desire of sinners
will perish.


[Gospel Canticle} “My soul magnifies
the Lord. {1:47} And my spirit leaps for joy in God my
Saviour. {1:48} For he has looked with favor on the humility
of his handmaid. For behold, from this time, all generations
shall call me blessed. {1:49} For he who is great has done
great things for me, and holy is his name. {1:50} And his
mercy is from generation to generations for those who fear
him. {1:51} He has accomplished powerful deeds with his
arm. He has scattered the arrogant in the intentions of their
heart. {1:52} He has deposed the powerful from their seat,
and he has exalted the humble. {1:53} He has filled the
hungry with good things, and the rich he has sent away
empty. {1:54} He has taken up his servant Israel, mindful of
his mercy, {1:55} just as he spoke to our fathers: to Abraham
and to his offspring forever.”

{112:3} From the rising of the sun, even to its setting,
praiseworthy is the name of the Lord. {112:4} The Lord is
high above all nations, and his glory is high above the
heavens. {112:5} Who is like the Lord, our God, who dwells
on high, {112:6} and who gazes upon the humble things in
heaven and on earth? {112:7} He lifts up the needy from the
ground, and he urges the poor away from filth, {112:8} so
that he may place him with the leaders, with the leaders of
his people. {112:9} He causes a barren woman to live in a
house, as the joyful mother of sons.

according to your word. {2:30} For my eyes have seen your

the glory of your people Israel.”

)Office of Readings

[Psalm 113] (Psalm 114115) {113:1} Alleluia. At the
departure of Israel from Egypt, the house of Jacob from a
barbarous people: {113:2} Judea was made his sanctuary;
Israel was made his power. {113:3} The sea looked, and it
fled. The Jordan was turned back again. {113:4} The
mountains exulted like rams, and the hills like lambs among
the sheep. {113:5} What happened to you, O sea, so that you
fled, and to you, O Jordan, so that you were turned back
again? {113:6} What happened to you, O mountains, so that
you exulted like rams, and to you, O hills, so that you exulted
like lambs among the sheep? {113:7} Before the face of the
Lord, the earth was moved, before the face of the God of
Jacob. {113:8} He converted the rock into pools of water,
and the cliff into fountains of waters.
{113:9} Not to us, O Lord, not to us, but to your name give
glory. {113:10} Give glory to your mercy and your truth, lest
the Gentiles should say, “Where is their God?” {113:11} But
our God is in heaven. All things whatsoever that he has
willed, he has done. {113:12} The idols of the nations are
silver and gold, the works of the hands of men.
{113:13} They have mouths, and do not speak; they have
eyes, and do not see. {113:14} They have ears, and do not
hear; they have noses, and do not smell. {113:15} They have
hands, and do not feel; they have feet, and do not walk.
Neither will they cry out with their throat. {113:16} Let those
who make them become like them, along with all who trust
in them. {113:17} The house of Israel has hoped in the Lord.
He is their helper and their protector. {113:18} The house of
Aaron has hoped in the Lord. He is their helper and their
protector. {113:19} Those who fear the Lord have hoped in
the Lord. He is their helper and their protector. {113:20} The
Lord has been mindful of us, and he has blessed us. He has
blessed the house of Israel. He has blessed the house of
Aaron. {113:21} He has blessed all who fear the Lord, the
small with the great. {113:22} May the Lord add blessings
upon you: upon you, and upon your sons. {113:23} Blessed
are you by the Lord, who made heaven and earth.
{113:24} The heaven of heaven is for the Lord, but the earth
he has given to the sons of men. {113:25} The dead will not
praise you, Lord, and neither will all those who descend into
Hell. {113:26} But we who live will bless the Lord, from this
time forward, and even forever.


[Psalm 114] (Psalm 116A) {114:1} Alleluia. I have loved:
therefore, the Lord will heed the voice of my prayer.
{114:2} For he has inclined his ear to me. And in my days, I
will call upon him. {114:3} The sorrows of death have
surrounded me, and the perils of Hell have found me. I have
found tribulation and sorrow. {114:4} And so, I called upon
the name of the Lord. O Lord, free my soul. {114:5} Merciful
is the Lord, and just. And our God is compassionate.
{114:6} The Lord is the keeper of little ones. I was humbled,
and he freed me. {114:7} Turn again, my soul, to your rest.
For the Lord has done good to you. {114:8} For he has
rescued my soul from death, my eyes from tears, my feet
from slipping. {114:9} I will please the Lord in the land of the
living.


)Morning Prayer

[Psalm 115] (Psalm 116B) {115:1} Alleluia. I had confidence,
because of what I was saying, but then I was greatly humbled.
{115:2} I said in my excess, “Every man is a liar.”
{115:3} What shall I repay to the Lord, for all the things that
he has repaid to me? {115:4} I will take up the cup of
salvation, and I will call upon the name of the Lord.
{115:5} I will repay my vows to the Lord, in the sight of all
his people. {115:6} Precious in the sight of the Lord is the
death of his holy ones. {115:7} O Lord, because I am your
servant, your servant and the son of your handmaid, you
have broken my bonds. {115:8} I will sacrifice to you the
sacrifice of praise, and I will invoke the name of the Lord.
{115:9} I will repay my vows to the Lord in the sight of all
his people, {115:10} in the courts of the house of the Lord, in
your midst, O Jerusalem.


[Psalm 116] (Psalm 117) {116:1} Alleluia. All nations, praise
the Lord. All peoples, praise him. {116:2} For his mercy has
been confirmed over us. And the truth of the Lord remains
for all eternity.


[Gospel Canticle] {1:68} “Blessed is the Lord God of Israel. For he has
visited and has wrought the redemption of his people.
{1:69} And he has raised up a horn of salvation for us, in the
house of David his servant, {1:70} just as he spoke by the
mouth of his holy Prophets, who are from ages past:
{1:71} salvation from our enemies, and from the hand of all
those who hate us, {1:72} to accomplish mercy with our
fathers, and to call to mind his holy testament, {1:73} the
oath, which he swore to Abraham, our father, that he would
grant to us, {1:74} so that, having been freed from the hand
of our enemies, we may serve him without fear, {1:75} in
holiness and in justice before him, throughout all our days.
{1:76} And you, child, shall be called the prophet of the Most
High. For you will go before the face of the Lord: to prepare
his ways, {1:77} to give knowledge of salvation to his people
for the remission of their sins, {1:78} through the heart of the
mercy of our God, by which, descending from on high, he
has visited us, {1:79} to illuminate those who sit in darkness
and in the shadow of death, and to direct our feet in the way
of peace.”


)Midday Prayer

[Psalm 117] (Psalm 118) {117:1} Alleluia. Confess to the
Lord, for he is good, for his mercy is forever. {117:2} Let
Israel now say: For he is good, for his mercy is forever.
{117:3} Let the house of Aaron now say: For his mercy is
forever. {117:4} Let those who fear the Lord now say: For
his mercy is forever. {117:5} In my tribulation, I called upon
the Lord. And the Lord heeded me with generosity.
{117:6} The Lord is my helper. I will not fear what man can
do to me. {117:7} The Lord is my helper. And I will look
down upon my enemies. {117:8} It is good to trust in the
Lord, rather than to trust in man. {117:9} It is good to hope
in the Lord, rather than to hope in leaders. {117:10} All the
nations have surrounded me. And, in the name of the Lord, I
have been avenged over them. {117:11} Surrounding me,
they closed in on me. And, in the name of the Lord, I have
been avenged over them. {117:12} They surrounded me like
a swarm, and they burned like fire among the thorns. And, in
the name of the Lord, I have been avenged over them.
{117:13} Having been pushed, I was overturned so as to fall.
But the Lord took me up. {117:14} The Lord is my strength
and my praise. And he has become my salvation. {117:15} A
voice of exultation and salvation is in the tabernacles of the
just. {117:16} The right hand of the Lord has wrought virtue.
The right hand of the Lord has exalted me. The right hand of
the Lord has wrought virtue. {117:17} I will not die, but I
will live. And I will declare the works of the Lord.
{117:18} When chastising, the Lord chastised me. But he has
not delivered me over to death. {117:19} Open the gates of
justice to me. I will enter them, and I will confess to the Lord.
{117:20} This is the gate of the Lord. The just will enter by it.
{117:21} I will confess to you because you have heard me.
And you have become my salvation. {117:22} The stone
which the builders have rejected, this has become the head of
the corner. {117:23} By the Lord has this been done, and it is
a wonder before our eyes. {117:24} This is the day that the
Lord has made. Let us exult and rejoice in it. {117:25} O
Lord, grant salvation to me. O Lord, grant good prosperity.
{117:26} Blessed is he who arrives in the name of the Lord.
We have blessed you from the house of the Lord.
{117:27} The Lord is God, and he has enlightened us.
Establish a solemn day amid a dense crowd, even to the horn
of the altar. {117:28} You are my God, and I will confess to
you. You are my God, and I will exalt you. I will confess to
you, for you have heeded me. And you have become my
salvation. {117:29} Confess to the Lord, for he is good, for
his mercy is forever.

are the immaculate in the way, who walk in the law of the
Lord. {118:2} Blessed are those who examine his testimonies.

work iniquity have not walked in his ways. {118:4} You have
ordered your commandments to be kept most diligently.
{118:5} I wish that my ways may be directed so as to keep
your justifications. {118:6} Then I will not be confounded,
when I will look into all your commandments. {118:7} I will
confess to you with honesty of heart. In this way, I have
learned the judgments of your justice. {118:8} I will keep
your justifications. Do not utterly abandon me.
{118:9} BETH. By what does an adolescent correct his way?
By keeping to your words. {118:10} With my whole heart, I

commandments. {118:11} I have hidden your eloquence in
my heart, so that I may not sin against you. {118:12} Blessed
are you, O Lord. Teach me your justifications.

commandments from me. {118:20} My soul has longed to

rebuked the arrogant. Those who decline from your
commandments are accursed. {118:22} Take me away from
disgrace and contempt, for I have sought your testimonies.
{118:23} For even the leaders sat and spoke against me. But
your servant has been trained in your justifications.
{118:24} For your testimonies are also my meditation, and
your justifications are my counsel.

weariness. Confirm me in your words. {118:29} Remove the
way of iniquity from me, and have mercy on me by your law.
{118:30} I have chosen the way of truth. I have not forgotten

which you have given me hope. {118:50} This has consoled
me in my humiliation, for your word has revived me.

not turned aside from your law. {118:52} I called to mind
your judgments of antiquity, O Lord, and I was consoled.
{118:53} Faintness has taken hold of me, because of the

his mercy, {1:55} just as he spoke to our fathers: to Abraham
and to his offspring forever.”


)Night Prayer

{118:97} (11) MEM. How have I loved your law, O Lord? It is
my meditation all day long. {118:98} By your commandment,
you have made me able to see far, beyond my enemies. For it
is with me for eternity. {118:99} I have understood beyond
all my teachers. For your testimonies are my meditation.
{118:100} I have understood beyond the elders. For I have
searched your commandments. {118:101} I have prohibited
my feet from every evil way, so that I may keep your words.
{118:102} I have not declined from your judgments, because
you have stationed a law for me. {118:103} How sweet is
your eloquence to my palate, more so than honey to my
mouth! {118:104}1I obtained understanding by your
commandments. Because of this, I have hated every way of
iniquity.


[Gospel Canticle] {2:29} “Now you may dismiss your servant in peace, O Lord,
according to your word. {2:30} For my eyes have seen your
salvation, {2:31} which you have prepared before the face of
all peoples: {2:32} the light of revelation to the nations and
the glory of your people Israel.”

and a light to my paths. {118:106} I have sworn it, and so I
am determined to keep the judgments of your justice.
{118:107} I have been altogether humbled, Lord. Revive me
according to your word. {118:108} Make the willing offerings
of my mouth well pleasing, Lord, and teach me your
judgments. {118:109} My soul is always in my hands, and I
have not forgotten your law. {118:110} Sinners have set a
snare for me, yet I have not strayed from your
commandments. {118:111} I have acquired your testimonies
as an inheritance unto eternity, because they are the
exultation of my heart. {118:112} I have inclined my heart to
do your justifications for eternity, as a recompense.


{118:113} (13) SAMECH. I have hated the iniquitous, and I have
loved your law. {118:114} You are my helper and my

{118:117} Help me, and I will be saved. And I will meditate

all those who fell away from your judgments. For their
intention is unjust. {118:119}I have considered all the
sinners of the earth to be transgressors. Therefore, I have
loved your testimonies. {118:120} Pierce my flesh with your
fear, for I am afraid of your judgments.


)Morning Prayer

have accomplished judgment and justice. Do not hand me
over to those who slander me. {118:122} Uphold your
servant in what is good. And do not allow the arrogant to
slander me. {118:123} My eyes have failed in your salvation
and in the eloquence of your justice. {118:124} Deal with
your servant according to your mercy, and teach me your
justifications. {118:125}I am your servant. Give me
understanding, so that I may know your testimonies.

your law. {118:127} Therefore, I have loved your
commandments beyond gold and topaz. {118:128} Because
of this, I was directed toward all your commandments. I held
hatred for every iniquitous way.


{118:129} (15) PHE. Your
testimonies are wonderful. Therefore, my soul has been
examined by them. {118:130} The declaration of your words
illuminates, and it gives understanding to little ones.
{118:131} I opened my mouth and drew breath, for I desired
your commandments. {118:132} Gaze upon me and be
merciful to me, according to the judgment of those who love
your name. {118:133} Direct my steps according to your
eloquence, and let no injustice rule over me.

visited and has wrought the redemption of his people.
{1:69} And he has raised up a horn of salvation for us, in the
house of David his servant, {1:70} just as he spoke by the
mouth of his holy Prophets, who are from ages past:

those who hate us, {1:72} to accomplish mercy with our
fathers, and to call to mind his holy testament, {1:73} the
oath, which he swore to Abraham, our father, that he would
grant to us, {1:74} so that, having been freed from the hand
of our enemies, we may serve him without fear, {1:75} in
holiness and in justice before him, throughout all our days.

High. For you will go before the face of the Lord: to prepare
his ways, {1:77} to give knowledge of salvation to his people
for the remission of their sins, {1:78} through the heart of the
mercy of our God, by which, descending from on high, he
has visited us, {1:79} to illuminate those who sit in darkness
and in the shadow of death, and to direct our feet in the way

)Midday Prayer

{118:137} (16) SADE. You
are just, O Lord, and your judgment is right. {118:138} You
have commanded justice: your testimonies and your truth
even more so. {118:139} My zeal has caused me to pine
away, because my enemies have forgotten your words.

your commandments. {118:147} I arrived first in maturity,
and so I cried out. For in your words, I have hoped beyond
hope. {118:148} My eyes preceded the dawn for you, so that
I might meditate on your eloquence. {118:149} Hear my
voice according to your mercy, O Lord. And revive me
according to your judgment. {118:150} Those who persecute
me have drawn near to iniquity, but they been brought far
from your law. {118:151} You are near, O Lord, and all your
ways are truth. {118:152} I have known from the beginning

have not forgotten your law. {118:154} Judge my judgment
and redeem me. Revive me because of your eloquence.

not inquired about your justifications. {118:156} Many are
your mercies, O Lord. Enliven me according to your
judgment. {118:157} Many are those who persecute me and
who trouble me. I have not turned away from your
testimonies. {118:158} I saw the prevaricators, and I pine
away. For they have not kept your word. {118:159} O Lord,
see how I have loved your commandments. Revive me in
your mercy. {118:160} The beginning of your words is truth.
All the judgments of your justice are for eternity.


[Gospel Canticle} “My soul magnifies
the Lord. {1:47} And my spirit leaps for joy in God my
Saviour. {1:48} For he has looked with favor on the humility
of his handmaid. For behold, from this time, all generations
shall call me blessed. {1:49} For he who is great has done
great things for me, and holy is his name. {1:50} And his
mercy is from generation to generations for those who fear
him. {1:51} He has accomplished powerful deeds with his
arm. He has scattered the arrogant in the intentions of their
heart. {1:52} He has deposed the powerful from their seat,
and he has exalted the humble. {1:53} He has filled the
hungry with good things, and the rich he has sent away
empty. {1:54} He has taken up his servant Israel, mindful of
his mercy, {1:55} just as he spoke to our fathers: to Abraham

{118:161} (19) SIN. The leaders have persecuted me without
cause. And my heart has been awed by your words.

has found many spoils. {118:163}I have held hatred for
iniquity, and I have abhorred it. Yet I have loved your law.
{118:164} Seven times a day, I uttered praise to you about
the judgments of your justice. {118:165} Those who love

your sight. Grant understanding to me according to your
eloquence. {118:170} Let my petition enter before you.

burst forth from my lips, when you will teach me your
justifications. {118:172} My tongue will pronounce your
eloquence. For all your commandments are fairness.
{118:173} Let it be your hand that saves me. For I have
chosen your commandments. {118:174} O Lord, I have
longed for your salvation, and your law is my meditation.
{118:175} My soul will live and will praise you, and your
judgments will assist me. {118:176} I have gone astray like a
sheep that is lost. Seek out your servant, for I have not
forgotten your commandments.


[Psalm 119] (Psalm 120) {119:1} A Canticle in steps. When
troubled, I cried out to the Lord, and he heard me. {119:2} O
Lord, free my soul from lips of iniquity and from the deceitful
tongue. {119:3} What will be given to you, or what will be
added to you, for a deceitful tongue?: {119:4} the sharp
arrows of the powerful, along with the burning coals of
desolation. {119:5} Woe to me, for my sojourning has been
prolonged. I have lived with the inhabitants of Kedar.
{119:6} My soul has long been a sojourner. {119:7} With
those who hated peace, I was peaceful. When I spoke to them,
they fought against me without cause.


)Morning Prayer

[Psalm 120] (Psalm 121) {120:1} A Canticle in steps. I have
lifted up my eyes to the mountains; from thence help will
come to me. {120:2} My help is from the Lord, who made
heaven and earth. {120:3} May he not allow your foot to be
moved, and may he not slumber, who guards you.
{120:4} Behold, he who guards Israel will neither sleep, nor
slumber. {120:5} The Lord is your keeper, the Lord is your
protection, above your right hand. {120:6} The sun will not
burn you by day, nor the moon by night. {120:7} The Lord
guards you from all evil. May the Lord guard your soul.
{120:8} May the Lord guard your entrance and your exit,
from this time forward and even forever.


[Psalm 121] (Psalm 122) {121:1} A Canticle in steps. I
rejoiced in the things that were said to me: “We shall go into
the house of the Lord.” {121:2} Our feet were standing in
your courts, O Jerusalem. {121:3} Jerusalem has been built
as a city, whose participation is unto itself. {121:4} For to
that place, the tribes ascended, the tribes of the Lord: the
testimony of Israel, to confess to the name of the Lord.
{121:5} For in that place, seats have sat down in judgment,
seats above the house of David. {121:6} Petition for the
things that are for the peace of Jerusalem, and for abundance
for those who love you. {121:7} Let peace be in your virtue,
and abundance in your towers. {121:8} For the sake of my
brothers and my neighbors, I spoke peace about you.
{121:9} For the sake of the house of the Lord our God, I
sought good things for you.

[Psalm 122] (Psalm 123) {122:1} A Canticle in steps. I have
lifted up my eyes to you, who dwells in the heavens.
{122:2} Behold, as the eyes of the servants are on the hands
of their masters, as the eyes of the handmaid are on the hands
of her mistress, so our eyes are upon the Lord our God, until
he may be merciful to us. {122:3} Have mercy on us, O Lord,
have mercy on us. For we have been filled with utter disdain.
{122:4} For our soul has been greatly filled. We are the
disgrace of those who have abundance and the disdain of the
arrogant.


)Evening Prayer

[Psalm 123] (Psalm 124) {123:1} A Canticle in steps. If the
Lord had not been with us, let Israel now say it: {123:2} if
the Lord had not been with us, when men rose up against us,
{123:3} perhaps they would have swallowed us alive. When
their fury was enraged against us, {123:4} perhaps the waters
would have engulfed us. {123:5} Our soul has passed through
a torrent. Perhaps, our soul had even passed through
intolerable water. {123:6} Blessed is the Lord, who has not
given us into the harm of their teeth. {123:7} Our soul has
been snatched away like a sparrow from the snare of the
hunters. The snare has been broken, and we have been freed.
{123:8} Our help is in the name of the Lord, who made
heaven and earth.


[Psalm 124] (Psalm 125) {124:1} A Canticle in steps. Those
who trust in the Lord will be like the mountain of Zion. He
will not be disturbed for eternity, who dwells {124:2} in
Jerusalem. Mountains surround it. And the Lord surrounds
his people, from this time forward and even forever.
{124:3} For the Lord will not allow the rod of sinners to
remain over the lot of the just, so that the just may not extend
their hands toward iniquity. {124:4} Do good, O Lord, to the
good and to the upright of heart. {124:5} But those who turn
away into obligation, the Lord will lead away with the
workers of iniquity. Peace be upon Israel.


[Gospel Canticle} “My soul magnifies
the Lord. {1:47} And my spirit leaps for joy in God my

)Night Prayer

[Psalm 125] (Psalm 126) {125:1} A Canticle in steps. When
the Lord turned back the captivity of Zion, we became like
those who are consoled. {125:2} Then our mouth was filled
with gladness and our tongue with exultation. Then they will
say among the nations: “The Lord has done great things for
them.” {125:3} The Lord has done great things for us. We
have become joyful. {125:4} Convert our captivity, O Lord,
like a torrent in the south. {125:5} Those who sow in tears
shall reap in exultation. {125:6} When departing, they went
forth and wept, sowing their seeds. {125:7} But when
returning, they will arrive with exultation, carrying their
sheaves.


[Gospel Canticle] {2:29} “Now you may dismiss your servant in peace, O Lord,
according to your word. {2:30} For my eyes have seen your

[Psalm 126] (Psalm 127) {126:1} A Canticle in steps: of
Solomon. Unless the Lord has built the house, those who
build it have labored in vain. Unless the Lord has guarded the
city, he who guards it watches in vain. {126:2} It is in vain
that you rise before daylight, that you rise up after you have
sat down, you who chew the bread of sorrow. Whereas, to
his beloved, he will give sleep. {126:3} Behold, the
inheritance of the Lord is sons, the reward is the fruit of the
womb. {126:4} Like arrows in the hand of the powerful, so
are the sons of those who have been cast out. {126:5} Blessed
is the man who has filled his desire from these things. He will
not be confounded when he speaks to his enemies at the gate.


[Psalm 127] (Psalm 128) {127:1} A Canticle in steps. Blessed
are all those who fear the Lord, who walk in his ways.
{127:2} For you will eat by the labors of your hands. Blessed
are you, and it will be well with you. {127:3} Your wife is
like an abundant vine on the sides of your house. Your sons
are like young olive trees surrounding your table.
{127:4} Behold, so will the man be blessed who fears the
Lord. {127:5} May the Lord bless you from Zion, and may
you see the good things of Jerusalem, all the days of your life.
{127:6} And may you see the sons of your sons. Peace be
upon Israel.


)Morning Prayer

[Psalm 128] (Psalm 129) {128:1} A Canticle in steps. They
have often fought against me from my youth, let Israel now
say: {128:2} they have often fought against me from my
youth, yet they could not prevail over me. {128:3} The
sinners have made fabrications behind my back. They have
prolonged their iniquity. {128:4} The just Lord will cut the
necks of sinners. {128:5} Let all those who hate Zion be
confounded and turned backwards. {128:6} Let them be like
grass on the rooftops, which withers before it can be pulled
up: {128:7} with it, he who reaps does not fill his hand and
he who gathers sheaves does not fill his bosom. {128:8} And
those who were passing by have not said to them: “The
blessing of the Lord be upon you. We have blessed you in the
name of the Lord.”


[Psalm 129] (Psalm 130) {129:1} A Canticle in steps. From
the depths, I have cried out to you, O Lord. {129:2} O Lord,
hear my voice. Let your ears be attentive to the voice of my
supplication. {129:3} If you, O Lord, were to heed iniquities,
who, O Lord, could persevere? {129:4} For with you, there is
forgiveness, and because of your law, I persevered with you,
Lord. My soul has persevered in his word. {129:5} My soul
has hoped in the Lord. {129:6} From the morning watch,
even until night, let Israel hope in the Lord. {129:7} For with
the Lord there is mercy, and with him there is bountiful
redemption. {129:8} And he will redeem Israel from all his
iniquities.


[Gospel Canticle] {1:68} “Blessed is the Lord God of Israel. For he has

)Midday Prayer

[Psalm 130] (Psalm 131) {130:1} A Canticle in steps: of
David. O Lord, my heart has not been exalted, and my eyes
have not been raised up. Neither have I walked in greatness,
nor in wonders beyond me. {130:2} When I was not humble
in thought, then I lifted up my soul. Like one who has been
weaned from his mother, so was I recompensed in my soul.
{130:3} Let Israel hope in the Lord, from this time forward
and even forever.


)Evening prayer

[Psalm 131] (Psalm 132) {131:1} A Canticle in steps. O Lord,
remember David and all his meekness, {131:2} how he swore
to the Lord, how he made a vow to the God of Jacob:
{131:3} I shall not enter into the tabernacle of my house, nor
climb into the bed where I lie down; {131:4} I shall not give
sleep to my eyes, nor slumber to my eyelids {131:5} and rest
to my temples, until I find a place for the Lord, a tabernacle
for the God of Jacob. {131:6} Behold, we heard of it in
Ephrathah. We discovered it in the fields of the forest.
{131:7} We will enter into his tabernacle. We will adore in
the place where his feet stood. {131:8} Rise up, O Lord, into
your resting place. You and the ark of your sanctification.
{131:9} Let your priests be clothed with justice, and let your
saints exult. {131:10} For the sake of your servant David, do
not turn away the face of your Christ. {131:11} The Lord has
sworn the truth to David, and he will not disappoint: I will
set upon your throne from the fruit of your lineage.
{131:12} If your sons will keep my covenant and these, my
testimonies, which I will teach to them, then their sons will
sit upon your throne even forever. {131:13} For the Lord has
chosen Zion. He has chosen it as his dwelling place.
{131:14} This is my resting place, forever and ever. Here I
will dwell, for I have chosen it. {131:15} When blessing, I
will bless her widow. I will satisfy her poor with bread.
{131:16} I will clothe her priests with salvation, and her
saints will rejoice with great joy. {131:17} There, I will
produce a horn to David. There, I have prepared a lamp for
my Christ. {131:18} I will clothe his enemies with confusion.
But my sanctification will flourish over him.


[Psalm 132] (Psalm 133) {132:1} A Canticle in steps: of
David. Behold, how good and how pleasing it is for brothers
to dwell in unity. {132:2} It is like the ointment on the head
that descended to the beard, the beard of Aaron, which
descended to the hem of his garment. {132:3} It is like the
dew of Hermon, which descended from mount Zion. For in
that place, the Lord has commanded a blessing, and life, even
unto eternity.

the Lord. {1:47} And my spirit leaps for joy in God my

the Lord. You servants, praise the Lord. {134:2} You who
stand in the house of the Lord, in the courts of the house of
our God: {134:3} praise the Lord, for the Lord is good. Sing
psalms to his name, for it is sweet. {134:4} For the Lord has
chosen Jacob for himself, Israel for his own possession.
{134:5} For I have known that the Lord is great, and our
God is before all gods. {134:6} All things whatsoever that he
willed, the Lord did: in heaven, on earth, in the sea, and in all
the deep places. {134:7} He leads clouds from the ends of the
earth. He has created lightnings in the rain. He has produced
winds from his storehouses. {134:8} He struck the first-born
of Egypt, from man even to cattle. {134:9} He sent signs and
wonders into your midst, O Egypt: upon Pharaoh and upon
all his servants. {134:10} He has struck many nations, and he
has slaughtered strong kings: {134:11} Sihon, king of the
Amorites, and Og, king of Bashan, and all the kingdoms of
Canaan. {134:12} And he gave their land as an inheritance,
as an inheritance for his people Israel. {134:13} Your name,
O Lord, is in eternity. Your memorial, O Lord, is from
generation to generation. {134:14} For the Lord will judge
his people, and he will be petitioned by his servants.
{134:15} The idols of the Gentiles are silver and gold, the
works of the hands of men. {134:16} They have a mouth,
and do not speak. They have eyes, and do not see.
{134:17} They have ears, and do not hear. For neither is
there any breath in their mouths. {134:18} Let those who
make them become like them, along with all who trust in
them. {134:19} Bless the Lord, O house of Israel. Bless the
Lord, O house of Aaron. {134:20} Bless the Lord, O house of
Levi. You who fear the Lord, bless the Lord. {134:21} The
Lord is blessed from Zion, by those who dwell in Jerusalem.

Lord, for he is good: for his mercy is eternal. {135:2} Confess

alone performs great miracles, for his mercy is eternal.
{135:5} He made the heavens with understanding, for his
mercy is eternal. {135:6} He established the earth above the
waters, for his mercy is eternal. {135:7} He made the great
lights, for his mercy is eternal: {135:8} the sun to rule the day,

rule the night, for his mercy is eternal. {135:10} He struck
Egypt along with their first-born, for his mercy is eternal.
{135:11} He led Israel away from their midst, for his mercy is
eternal: {135:12} with a powerful hand and an outstretched
arm, for his mercy is eternal. {135:13} He divided the Red
Sea into separate parts, for his mercy is eternal. {135:14} And
he led out Israel through the middle of it, for his mercy is
eternal. {135:15} And he shook off Pharaoh and his army in
the Red Sea, for his mercy is eternal. {135:16} He led his
people through the desert, for his mercy is eternal.
{135:17} He has struck great kings, for his mercy is eternal.
{135:18} And he has slaughtered strong kings, for his mercy
is eternal: {135:19} Sihon, king of the Amorites, for his
mercy is eternal: {135:20} and Og, king of Bashan, for his
mercy is eternal. {135:21} And he granted their land as an
inheritance, for his mercy is eternal: {135:22}as an
inheritance for his servant Israel, for his mercy is eternal.
{135:23} For he was mindful of us in our humiliation, for his
mercy is eternal. {135:24} And he redeemed us from our
enemies, for his mercy is eternal. {135:25} He gives food to
all flesh, for his mercy is eternal. {135:26} Confess to the
God of heaven, for his mercy is eternal. {135:27} Confess to
the Lord of lords, for his mercy is eternal.


)Morning Prayer

[Psalm 136] (Psalm 137) {136:1} A Psalm of David: to
Jeremiah. Above the rivers of Babylon, there we sat and wept,
while we remembered Zion. {136:2} By the willow trees, in
their midst, we hung up our instruments. {136:3} For, in that
place, those who led us into captivity questioned us about the
words of the songs. And those who carried us away said:
“Sing us a hymn from the songs of Zion.” {136:4} How can
we sing a song of the Lord in a foreign land? {136:5} If I ever
forget you, Jerusalem, let my right hand be forgotten.
{136:6} May my tongue adhere to my jaws, if I do not
remember you, if I do not set Jerusalem first, as the beginning
of my joy. {136:7} O Lord, call to mind the sons of Edom, in
the day of Jerusalem, who say: “Despoil it, despoil it, even to
its foundation.” {136:8} O daughter of Babylon, have pity.
Blessed is he who will repay you with your payment, which
you have paid to us. {136:9} Blessed is he who will take hold
of your little ones and dash them against the rock.


[Psalm 137] (Psalm 138) {137:1} Of David himself. O Lord,
I will confess to you with my whole heart, for you have heard
the words of my mouth. I will sing psalms to you in the sight
of the Angels. {137:2} I will adore before your holy temple,
and I will confess your name: it is above your mercy and
your truth. For you have magnified your holy name above all.
{137:3} On whatever day that I will call upon you: hear me.
You will multiply virtue in my soul. {137:4} May all the
kings of the earth confess to you, O Lord. For they have
heard all the words of your mouth. {137:5} And let them sing
in accordance with the ways of the Lord. For great is the
glory of the Lord. {137:6} For the Lord is exalted, and he
looks with favor on the humble. But the lofty he knows from
a distance. {137:7} If I wander into the midst of tribulation,
you will revive me. For you extended your hand against the
wrath of my enemies. And your right hand has accomplished
my salvation. {137:8} The Lord will provide retribution on
my behalf. O Lord, your mercy is forever. Do not disdain the
works of your hands.


[Gospel Canticle] {1:68} “Blessed is the Lord God of Israel. For he has
visited and has wrought the redemption of his people.
{1:69} And he has raised up a horn of salvation for us, in the
house of David his servant, {1:70} just as he spoke by the
mouth of his holy Prophets, who are from ages past:
{1:71} salvation from our enemies, and from the hand of all
those who hate us, {1:72} to accomplish mercy with our
fathers, and to call to mind his holy testament, {1:73} the
oath, which he swore to Abraham, our father, that he would
grant to us, {1:74} so that, having been freed from the hand
of our enemies, we may serve him without fear, {1:75} in
holiness and in justice before him, throughout all our days.
{1:76} And you, child, shall be called the prophet of the Most
High. For you will go before the face of the Lord: to prepare
his ways, {1:77} to give knowledge of salvation to his people
for the remission of their sins, {1:78} through the heart of the
mercy of our God, by which, descending from on high, he
has visited us, {1:79} to illuminate those who sit in darkness
and in the shadow of death, and to direct our feet in the way
of peace.”


)Midday Prayer

[Psalm 138] (Psalm 139) {138:1} Unto the end. A Psalm of
David. O Lord, you have examined me, and you have known
me. {138:2} You have known my sitting down and my rising
up again. {138:3} You have understood my thoughts from
afar. My path and my fate, you have investigated.
{138:4} And you have foreseen all my ways. For there is no
word in my tongue. {138:5} Behold, O Lord, you have
known all things: the newest and the very old. You have
formed me, and you have placed your hand over me.
{138:6} Your knowledge has become a wonder to me. It has
been reinforced, and I am not able to prevail against it.
{138:7} Where will I go from your Spirit? And where will I
flee from your face? {138:8} If I ascend into heaven, you are
there. If I descend into Hell, you are near. {138:9} If I
assume my feathers in early morning, and dwell in the utmost
parts of the sea, {138:10} even there, your hand will lead me
forth, and your right hand will hold me. {138:11} And I said:
Perhaps darkness will overwhelm me, and the night will be
my illumination, to my delight. {138:12} But darkness will
not be impenetrable to you, and night will illuminate like the
day: for just as its darkness is, so also is its light. {138:13} For
you have possessed my temperament. You have supported
me from the womb of my mother. {138:14} I will confess to
you, for you have been magnified terribly. Your works are
miraculous, as my soul knows exceedingly well. {138:15} My
bone, which you have made in secret, has not been hidden
from you, and my substance is in accord with the lower parts
of the earth. {138:16} Your eyes saw my imperfection, and
all this shall be written in your book. Days will be formed,
and no one shall be in them. {138:17} But to me, O God,
your friends have been greatly honored. Their first ruler has
been exceedingly strengthened. {138:18} I will number them,
and they will be more numerous than the sand. I rose up, and
I am still with you. {138:19} O God, if only you would cut
down sinners. You men of blood: depart from me.
{138:20} For you say in thought: They will accept your cities
in vain. {138:21} Have I not hated those who hated you,
Lord, and wasted away because of your enemies? {138:22} I
have hated them with a perfect hatred, and they have become
enemies to me. {138:23} Examine me, O God, and know my
heart. Question me, and know my paths. {138:24} And see if
there might be in me the way of iniquity, and lead me in the
way of eternity.


)Evening Prayer

[Psalm 139] (Psalm 140) {139:1} Unto the end. A Psalm of
David. {139:2} Rescue me, O Lord, from the evil man.
Rescue me from the iniquitous leader. {139:3} Those who
have devised iniquities in their hearts: all day long they
constructed conflicts. {139:4} They have sharpened their
tongues like a serpent. The venom of asps is under their lips.
{139:5} Preserve me, O Lord, from the hand of the sinner,
and rescue me from men of iniquity. They have decided to
supplant my steps. {139:6} The arrogant have hidden a snare
for me. And they have stretched out cords for a snare. They
have placed a stumbling block for me near the road. {139:7} I
said to the Lord: You are my God. O Lord, heed the voice of
my supplication. {139:8} Lord, O Lord, the strength of my
salvation: you have overshadowed my head in the day of war.
{139:9} O Lord, do not hand me over to the sinner by my
desire. They have plotted against me. Do not abandon me,
lest they should triumph. {139:10} The head of those who
encompass me, the labor of their lips, will overwhelm them.
{139:11} Burning coals will fall upon them. You will cast
them down into the fire, into miseries that they will not be
able to withstand. {139:12} A talkative man will not be
guided aright upon the earth. Evils will drag the unjust man
unto utter ruin. {139:13}I know that the Lord will
accomplish justice for the needy and vindication for the poor.
{139:14} So then, truly, the just will confess your name, and
the upright will dwell with your countenance.


[Psalm 140] (Psalm 141) {140:1} A Psalm of David. O Lord,
I have cried out to you, hear me. Attend to my voice, when I
cry out to you. {140:2} Let my prayer be guided like incense
in your sight: the lifting up of my hands, like the evening
sacrifice. {140:3} O Lord, station a guard over my mouth and
a door enclosing my lips. {140:4} Do not turn aside my heart
to words of malice, to making excuses for sins, with men who
work iniquity; and I will not communicate, even with the best
of them. {140:5} The just one will correct me with mercy,
and he will rebuke me. But do not allow the oil of the sinner
to fatten my head. For my prayer will still be toward their
good will. {140:6} Their judges have been engulfed, joined to
the rocks. They will hear my words, which have prevailed,
{140:7} as when the lava of the earth has erupted above
ground. Our bones have been scattered beside Hell.
{140:8} For Lord, O Lord, my eyes look to you. In you, I
have hoped. Do not take away my soul. {140:9} Protect me
from the snare that they have set up for me and from the
scandals of those who work iniquity. {140:10} The sinners
will fall into his net. I am alone, until I pass over.


[Gospel Canticle} “My soul magnifies
the Lord. {1:47} And my spirit leaps for joy in God my
Saviour. {1:48} For he has looked with favor on the humility
of his handmaid. For behold, from this time, all generations
shall call me blessed. {1:49} For he who is great has done
great things for me, and holy is his name. {1:50} And his
mercy is from generation to generations for those who fear
him. {1:51} He has accomplished powerful deeds with his
arm. He has scattered the arrogant in the intentions of their
heart. {1:52} He has deposed the powerful from their seat,
and he has exalted the humble. {1:53} He has filled the
hungry with good things, and the rich he has sent away
empty. {1:54} He has taken up his servant Israel, mindful of
his mercy, {1:55} just as he spoke to our fathers: to Abraham
and to his offspring forever.”


)Night Prayer

[Psalm 141] (Psalm 142) {141:1} The understanding of
David. A prayer, when he was in the cave. {141:2} With my
voice, I cried out to the Lord. With my voice, I made
supplication to the Lord. {141:3} In his sight, I pour out my
prayer, and before him, I declare my tribulation.
{141:4} Though my spirit may become faint within me, even
then, you have known my paths. Along this way, which I
have been walking, they have hidden a snare for me.
{141:5} I considered toward the right, and I looked, but there
was no one who would know me. Flight has perished before
me, and there is no one who has concern for my soul.
{141:6} I cried out to you, O Lord. I said: You are my hope,
my portion in the land of the living. {141:7} Attend to my
supplication. For I have been humbled exceedingly. Free me
from my persecutors, for they have been fortified against me.
{141:8} Lead my soul out of confinement in order to confess
your name. The just are waiting for me, until you repay me.


[Gospel Canticle] {2:29} “Now you may dismiss your servant in peace, O Lord,
according to your word. {2:30} For my eyes have seen your
salvation, {2:31} which you have prepared before the face of
all peoples: {2:32} the light of revelation to the nations and
the glory of your people Israel.”


]Saturday 3

)Office of Readings

[Psalm 142] (Psalm 143) {142:1} A Psalm of David, when
his son Absalom was pursuing him. O Lord, hear my prayer.
Incline your ear to my supplication in your truth. Heed me
according to your justice. {142:2} And do not enter into
judgment with your servant. For all the living will not be
justified in your sight. {142:3} For the enemy has pursued my
soul. He has lowered my life to the earth. He has stationed
me in darkness, like the dead of ages past. {142:4} And my
spirit has been in anguish over me. My heart within me has
been disturbed. {142:5} I have called to mind the days of
antiquity. I have been meditating on all your works. I have
meditated on the workings of your hands. {142:6} I have
extended my hands to you. My soul is like a land without
water before you. {142:7} O Lord, heed me quickly. My
spirit has grown faint. Do not turn your face away from me,
lest I become like those who descend into the pit.
{142:8} Make me hear your mercy in the morning. For I
have hoped in you. Make known to me the way that I should
walk. For I have lifted up my soul to you. {142:9} O Lord,
rescue me from my enemies. I have fled to you.
{142:10} Teach me to do your will. For you are my God.
Your good Spirit will lead me into the righteous land.
{142:11} For the sake of your name, O Lord, you will revive
me in your fairness. You will lead my soul out of tribulation.
{142:12} And you will scatter my enemies in your mercy.
And you will destroy all those who afflict my soul. For I am
your servant.


[Psalm 143] (Psalm 144) {143:1} A Psalm of David versus
Goliath. Blessed is the Lord, my God, who trains my hands
for the battle and my fingers for the war. {143:2} My mercy
and my refuge, my supporter and my deliverer, my protector
and him in whom I have hoped: he subdues my people under
me. {143:3} O Lord, what is man that you have become
known to him? Or the son of man that you consider him?
{143:4} Man has been made similar to vanity. His days pass
by like a shadow. {143:5} O Lord, incline your heavens and
descend. Touch the mountains, and they will smoke.
{143:6} Send a flash of lightning, and you will scatter them.
Shoot your arrows, and you will set them in disarray.
{143:7} Send forth your hand from on high: rescue me, and
free me from many waters, from the hand of the sons of
foreigners. {143:8} Their mouth has been speaking vain
things, and their right hand is the right hand of iniquity.
{143:9} To you, O God, I will sing a new song. On the
psaltery, with an instrument of ten strings, I will sing psalms
to you. {143:10} He gives salvation to kings. He has
redeemed your servant David from the malignant sword.
{143:11} Rescue me, and deliver me from the hand of the
sons of foreigners. Their mouth has been speaking vain things,
and their right hand is the right hand of iniquity.
{143:12} Their sons are like new plantings in their youth.
Their daughters are dressed up: adorned all around like the
idols of a temple. {143:13} Their cupboards are full:
overflowing from one thing into another. Their sheep bear
young, brought forth in abundance. {143:14} Their cattle are
fat. There is no ruined wall or passage, nor anyone crying out
in their streets. {143:15} They have called the people that has
these things: blessed. But blessed is the people whose God is
the Lord.

single day, I will bless you. And I will praise your name, in
this time and forever and ever. {144:3} The Lord is great and
exceedingly praiseworthy. And there is no end to his
greatness. {144:4} Generation after generation will praise

to the sons of men your power and the glory of your

down, and he sets upright all who have been thrown down.
{144:15} O Lord, all eyes hope in you, and you provide their
food in due time. {144:16} You open your hand, and you fill
every kind of animal with a blessing. {144:17} The Lord is
just in all his ways and holy in all his works. {144:18} The
Lord is near to all who call upon him, to all who call upon
him in truth. {144:19} He will do the will of those who fear
him, and he will heed their supplication and accomplish their
salvation. {144:20} The Lord watches over all who love him.

speak the praise of the Lord, and may all flesh bless his holy
name, in this time and forever and ever.


[Psalm 145] (Psalm 146) {145:1} Alleluia. Of Haggai and
Zachariah. {145:2} Praise the Lord, O my soul. I will praise
the Lord with my life. I will sing psalms to my God as long as
I shall be. Do not trust in the leaders, {145:3} in the sons of
men, in whom there is no salvation. {145:4} His spirit will
depart, and he will return to his earth. In that day, all their
thoughts will perish. {145:5} Blessed is he whose help is the
God of Jacob: his hope is in the Lord God himself,
{145:6} who made heaven and earth, the sea, and all the
things that are in them. {145:7} He preserves the truth forever.
He executes judgment for those who suffer injury. He
provides food for the hungry. The Lord releases those who
are bound. {145:8} The Lord enlightens the blind. The Lord
sets upright those who have been thrown down. The Lord
loves the just. {145:9} The Lord watches over new arrivals.
He will support the orphan and the widow. And he will
destroy the ways of sinners. {145:10} The Lord shall reign
forever: your God, O Zion, from generation to generation.

visited and has wrought the redemption of his people.
{1:69} And he has raised up a horn of salvation for us, in the
house of David his servant, {1:70} just as he spoke by the
mouth of his holy Prophets, who are from ages past:
{1:71} salvation from our enemies, and from the hand of all
those who hate us, {1:72} to accomplish mercy with our
fathers, and to call to mind his holy testament, {1:73} the
oath, which he swore to Abraham, our father, that he would
grant to us, {1:74} so that, having been freed from the hand
of our enemies, we may serve him without fear, {1:75} in
holiness and in justice before him, throughout all our days.
{1:76} And you, child, shall be called the prophet of the Most
High. For you will go before the face of the Lord: to prepare
his ways, {1:77} to give knowledge of salvation to his people
for the remission of their sins, {1:78} through the heart of the

has visited us, {1:79} to illuminate those who sit in darkness

close to him. Alleluia.
[Psalm 149] {149:1} Alleluia. Sing to the Lord a new song.
His praise is in the Church of the saints. {149:2} Let Israel
rejoice in him who made them, and let the sons of Zion exult
in their king. {149:3} Let them praise his name in chorus. Let
them sing psalms to him with the timbrel and the psaltery.
{149:4} For the Lord is well pleased with his people, and he
will exalt the meek unto salvation. {149:5} The saints will
exult in glory. They will rejoice upon their couches.
{149:6} The exultations of God will be in their throat, and
two-edged swords will be in their hands: {149:7} to obtain
vindication among the nations, chastisements among the
peoples, {149:8} to bind their kings with shackles and their
nobles with manacles of iron, {149:9} to obtain judgment
over them, as it has been written. This is glory for all his
saints. Alleluia.


[Gospel Canticle} “My soul magnifies
the Lord. {1:47} And my spirit leaps for joy in God my
Saviour. {1:48} For he has looked with favor on the humility
of his handmaid. For behold, from this time, all generations
shall call me blessed. {1:49} For he who is great has done
great things for me, and holy is his name. {1:50} And his
mercy is from generation to generations for those who fear
him. {1:51} He has accomplished powerful deeds with his
arm. He has scattered the arrogant in the intentions of their
heart. {1:52} He has deposed the powerful from their seat,
and he has exalted the humble. {1:53} He has filled the
hungry with good things, and the rich he has sent away
empty. {1:54} He has taken up his servant Israel, mindful of
his mercy, {1:55} just as he spoke to our fathers: to Abraham
and to his offspring forever.”
